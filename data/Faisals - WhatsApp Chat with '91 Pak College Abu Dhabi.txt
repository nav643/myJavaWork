9/17/16, 6:38 AM - You added Shoaib Butt
9/17/16, 6:48 AM - Mashood Yunus: yes br inaam, same request for dua as you are in best of the places. may Allah (swt) accept your Hajj,  and give us all tawfeeq to be there
9/17/16, 6:49 AM - Mashood Yunus: going forward, Umrah is not going to be as easy anymore with the new policies coming in effect this year so yes, please remember us in dua for that too and that the authorities change their mind :) in US, some travel agents have decided to add their own extra charges for Umrah besides the $550 being charged by Saudi authorities for those who are returning for Umrah
9/17/16, 6:52 AM - Mashood Yunus: great reminders from rest of you about Hajj and dua
9/17/16, 6:54 AM - Mashood Yunus: Br Sabir, that is a good idea (to post past and recent pics), thanks for your update.  I am sitting next to you in a white shirt in the pic you posted.  I already posted my pic yesterday along with my daughter and niece. Alhamdulillah, blessed with best of everything in this life and all is going well
9/17/16, 7:15 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Mashood can you please elaborate the new policy you are talking about
9/17/16, 7:21 AM - Mashood Yunus: yes sure.  I have been wanting to reserve tickets for Umrah travel in January, usually an economical time to go for Umrah.  however saudi authorities have a new policy of charging $550 / person for Umrah visa now ONLY for those who are coming for Umrah for 2nd time.  first time Umrah travelers will NOT be charged this fee so for them Umrah visa is free
9/17/16, 7:21 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Yes Mashood I know already that you are sitting beside in white shirt. I remember you very well. I saw your previous picture also ma sha Allah. God bless you. Stay well. I have the pic in which we performed milli naghma Iqbal hae Iqbal hae Iqbal hamara üòä
9/17/16, 7:23 AM - Mashood Yunus: it seems this fee is applicable on everyone.  my brother in pakistan mentions that even if I tried to get the Umrah visa from pakistan or UAE on pakistani passport, I will still be charged equivalent of $550
9/17/16, 7:24 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes Sabir, masha-Allah :) remember that nice Pakisan auditorium as well as all the good days we were blessed with as children masha-Allah!
9/17/16, 7:24 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: <Media omitted>
9/17/16, 7:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: i believe it is mubashir and atif on my left side but both of them left pakistani school is 5th and 6th grade if I remember right.  atif's brother Amir is in US and is always in touch with my younger brother masaood however I am not in touch with Atif (except a phone call in 2002).  I totally lost contact with Mubashir as well as Habib Khan, Farooq shah and Fareed shah.  I was hoping if Maqbool was in touch with any of them but in my last trip to UAE, I could not meet Maqbool except a quick call on phone.  insha-Allah next time.
9/17/16, 7:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: however in this pic, on our right in another guy between you and me and he was with us in 1st year and 2nd year
9/17/16, 7:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: i forget his name
9/17/16, 7:33 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Yeah he is saif Abdullah. After college he went to Newyork.  I was in contact with him for quite some time but now lost contact. Far left is Shehzad Ahmed. Shehzad ia now surgion working in London. Still in contact
9/17/16, 7:36 AM - Mashood Yunus: masha-Allah, He has granted success to many of us in this world.  thanks for sharing Saif's name
9/17/16, 7:36 AM - Mashood Yunus: that reminds me about Saif ullah.  i also lost contact with him, along with shakil, saif was my class mate for almost all of my years at pakistani school from KG to 12th grade
9/17/16, 8:28 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Mashood even when Umra visa was free travel agents in Pakistan  charge 10000 rupees for it
9/17/16, 9:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hajj or Umrah . it will become exceedingly difficult going forward. The region is changing rapidly. May Allah give us tawfeeq to visit His House. Ameen

9/17/16, 4:34 PM - Mashood Yunus: I see kashif jabbaar in this picture, next to zubair? Or abdul hafeez. I am not sure. Also is it m Ali butt in black cloths?
9/17/16, 4:39 PM - Mashood Yunus: is it really shoaib? why does he look so much like aroosh?  must be old age for me :)  and is it mazhar or murtaza next to mubashir?
9/17/16, 4:50 PM - Nassar Nizami: Atif is somewhere in Karachi. I was in touch with him till late nineties.
9/17/16, 4:54 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Mashood, you got both M Ali and Kashif right in the picture shared by Imran
9/17/16, 4:57 PM - Mashood Yunus: ok thx faisal, one mystery solved.  I dont think kashif jabaar has been in touch with many people
9/17/16, 4:58 PM - Faisal Farooqi: In my picture it is Mazhar, Murtaza was not in AbuDhabi during 2nd year. Murtaza has confirmed himself that it is not him üòÉ
9/17/16, 4:59 PM - Mashood Yunus: Thx to this list, BTW,  saifullah just called me an hour ago from UK.  it was great catching up with him.  Like Shakeel, Zahid and Maqbool, he was my classmate since child hood.  it was great to hear his voice finally after so many years
9/17/16, 5:01 PM - Mashood Yunus: ok mazhar is confirmed too.  I had forgotten so many people and faces but slowly all are returning although mazhar will take some time.  I did meet zaraar when he was in Minnesota until year 2000 I think.  I did meet adeel in minnesota until he moved back to UAE around 1998 but I never got a chance to meet mubashir, although I heard that he was in Minnesota too.

9/19/16, 4:08 PM - Mohammad Ali: Since Whatsapp is now owned by Facebook (I think), they might be thinking of same
9/19/16, 4:08 PM - Mohammad Ali: Similar to Facebook live
9/19/16, 4:08 PM - Asif Bashir: Nice video
9/19/16, 4:09 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Due to encryption of whatsapp messages it won't be possible to feed messages in this chat to facebook, at least that is how I understand it
9/19/16, 4:09 PM - Asif Bashir: Reality of life sucks

9/19/16, 4:45 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Ok, time for some housekeeping again :)

9/19/16, 4:45 PM - Mashood Yunus: ooops, ab hum nay kya kiyaa
9/19/16, 4:46 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I have added a contact list with names and numbers so it is easy to identify when someone is not in contact list
9/19/16, 4:46 PM - Mashood Yunus: phew, awesome list.  are these all the guys from our class or does it havve some guys from other classes too?
9/19/16, 4:47 PM - Faisal Farooqi: '?' means the number is unverified for the purpose of this group, so these guys better say something
9/19/16, 4:47 PM - Mashood Yunus: saif, i assure , is correct number
9/19/16, 4:47 PM - Faisal Farooqi: If I marked ? by mistake please accept advance apologies and let me know... I will fix it üòÉ
9/19/16, 4:47 PM - Mashood Yunus: he called from that number and wrote me texts from there but may be he is still warming up to such a big group on whatsapp and might post later on
9/19/16, 4:47 PM - Imran Farhat: Faisal what about Ali Zaker Naqvi
9/19/16, 4:49 PM - Faisal Farooqi: so now on to other things.... how do we ensure we have our close friends on the list but somehow keep it manageable
9/19/16, 4:51 PM - Faisal Farooqi: initially it was thought of as a group for those who were in the 91 batch... but obviously some left AbuDhabi earlier even when they were with most of us for years.... similarly Urdu medium and English medium got combined at one point etc
9/19/16, 4:52 PM - Faisal Farooqi: So I think we all should have a say on how we expand membership but keep it interesting
9/19/16, 4:52 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Similarly we have added some without directly asking their permission beforehand, I hope they do not mind and will consider staying on even if they decide to not participate actively
9/19/16, 4:52 PM - Asif Bashir: Charge everyone
9/19/16, 4:53 PM - Asif Bashir: The one interested to stay in the group will pay

9/19/16, 4:57 PM - Imran Farhat: No . I am sure mohammed Ali can help you with his number
9/19/16, 4:58 PM - Mashood Yunus: Hmm good points. So I think we all will need to think about it so we can have thia group working in long term
9/19/16, 5:33 PM - Ziad Asghar: I think we have a good group now.  If we add more, it will go the way of other efforts to connect.  This is a good core group.

9/20/16, 1:24 AM - Mashood Yunus: But while at it, ziad had sent me a prayer rug in 1993 when I requested him on phone. I am not sure what was my situation but small acts of goodness go a long way ...

9/20/16, 3:01 AM - Mohammad Ali: I see Murtaza left the groupüòß. Maybe some reason...
9/20/16, 3:04 AM - Mohammad Ali: <Media omitted>
9/20/16, 3:04 AM - Mohammad Ali: Shajeeullahüòä , Kya haal hain BHAI, Mohammad Ali here
9/20/16, 3:11 AM - Mohammad Ali: Adnan (Tadoo), Shajee, Waseem, Hamed are ‚úî
9/20/16, 3:11 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: He might have left coz of so many messages. 
I suggest we try to speak to eachother in private chats. 
Group is a meeting point where we can find each other.  We limit our conversations in group to only announcements or memories which we would like to share with all.
9/20/16, 3:12 AM - Mohammad Ali: Just spoke to Hamed, he's bit hesitant but enjoying, really had a great conversation with him. 


Hamid piyaa... Break the ice. Yara audio record kar Kay daal day... Everyone will love it
9/20/16, 3:16 AM - Mohammad Ali: That's true Sabir, I agree, but I think it's not possible for few days at least (maybe a month) till we all settle down. Then this group will only have greetings, Eid, new year, birthday and other similar messages only. Right now, it is difficult.

Abhi aisa huwa to we all will say... Saalay, Hamain kyun nahin bataya.....üôÇ
9/20/16, 3:22 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Hahaha ......
True Muhammed Ali but still we can chat privately on many issues just to save the group and say whatever we want in one message also instead of sending 50 messages for one say. I am saying it just to save the group . Tomorrow again someone might leave the group like Murtaza did. So if we keep in mind some small things while chating I guess this group will have longer life üò¨
9/20/16, 3:35 AM - Mohammad Ali: Spoke to Shoaib just now, after 91. Feeling blessed. Time to call Maqbool after prayers..

9/20/16, 5:53 AM - Hamid Hussain: honey check amir sattar contact he is in abu dhabi
9/20/16, 5:55 AM - Imran Farhat: Everyone in this group has his own priorities which doesn't mean that we implement limits to those who are more excited and trying to wipe off the dust from the past calenders which for sure will be a little time consuming I must agree but those few of us who are really excited  (namely Mashood , Aqeel , Faisal , etc) are giving the rest a free ride to the past and letting them recall many things they really wanted to without an input .
All of us I think are gadget friendly and we understand how to avoid things , 1st we know we can mute the group and secondly for those who can not go through all those 500 or more messages and they also want to keep there memory free can straight away go to clear chat and save time (many of us can not resist reading).
We all are mature enough to understand that this group is a few days old and these messages are the result of excitement which will be for a few weeks and then you will only see occasional messages .
My personal opinion is that we don't restrict anyone and enjoy there excitement to the fullest  (along ourselves) and this doesn't mean that I am trying to burden my thoughts on the rest , every opinion is important and we should value that .
9/20/16, 6:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Amrold you roll!!!!

9/20/16, 6:41 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Haha
9/20/16, 6:41 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Since Murtaza is not on I'll explain on his behalf. He is in ICU shift these days and his hospital uses whatsapp as a communication tool. Our messages keep forcing him to check as there is no way to disable group notification which show up on screen. He will be back InshaAllah once the initial high traffic phase is over.
9/20/16, 6:42 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Good Faisal

9/20/16, 6:47 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and
9/20/16, 6:49 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: I remember when Ali's little sister or niece was being bullied by some boy in her class. He told me to t complain to teacher about the boy as he was too shy to go there. When I went to her class and stood beside her she hardly came up to my knees. She was in prep I think.
9/20/16, 6:50 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: thats cute
9/20/16, 6:50 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Ali stood outside the class ... Too afraid to go in
9/20/16, 6:50 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: That was so cute. The teacher was also surprised as how I had such small sister
9/20/16, 6:52 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Remember when girls had to go to play area they had to cross boys section. We would stare at them from our class as we were on first floor
9/20/16, 6:52 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: khwaar of the highest order
9/20/16, 6:52 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: All boys of that age are khwaar.
9/20/16, 6:53 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: no we were different
9/20/16, 6:53 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: If he is not khwaar there is something seriously wrong with him
9/20/16, 6:53 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I dont recall the group trip but once I was 'forced' to go to girls section when someone got injured during recess. I took the injured buddy to the medical room and due to missing bandage I was asked by the nurse to go somewhere in girls section and get it. All who were busy playing and could not help the injured were left regretting the decision to play. üòÅüòÅ
9/20/16, 6:53 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: khwaar took on a different meaning after us
9/20/16, 6:54 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faisal we did not go on that spy mission being Saviors like you

9/21/16, 7:35 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I will check with Ahsan about Amir Nawaz, Ahsan used to be in contact with him after school
9/21/16, 7:36 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Salaam all... Just finished my assignment...... Reading 895 messages
9/21/16, 7:37 PM - Faisal Farooqi: and this is after the fact that before Aqeel's message there was no message for at least 4 hours
9/21/16, 7:37 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal... Good to see u going strong with gathering finding friends... Thanks a lot
9/21/16, 7:37 PM - Shakil Ahmed: I am very interested in listening to that tapr

9/21/16, 8:29 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yep u r right Faisal
9/21/16, 8:35 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Before folks ask, it was Ahmer Kazim who left a few messages ago
9/21/16, 8:37 PM - Faisal Farooqi: He said that since he left school in grade 7 he was not able to relate with the discussions, so no hard feeling against anyone. If anyone needs to talk to him please feel free to contact him directly via whatsapp
9/21/16, 8:40 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Update on Tauqeer Sehar Butt, he is apparently in Saudia. Search for contact info continues....

9/21/16, 8:46 PM - Imran Farhat: üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

9/21/16, 9:11 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Anyone in / coming over to Isb / Rwp is most welcome  and should definitely meet.
9/21/16, 9:12 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Ziad. All well by the grace of Allah. Pressures from East & West are enormous. But so is our resolve.
9/21/16, 9:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Alhamdolillah.  Western one is crazy, given his much Pakistan has sacrificed for them.
9/21/16, 9:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Most that I run into here are Uber anti Pakistan.
9/21/16, 9:15 PM - Ziad Asghar: *how
9/21/16, 9:15 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: West is extremely complex, varied international & regional players and diverse interests. Unless an all inclusive political discourse ensues, status quo will persist.
9/21/16, 9:17 PM - Ziad Asghar: Agree, in the end battle is fought on the financial field too and there the eastern neighbor is doing much better now.  That has big implications.
9/21/16, 9:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: <Media omitted>
9/21/16, 9:19 PM - Imran Farhat: Naveed looking forward for a walk together like early ages
9/21/16, 9:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Here is to our Water Cooler discussion needs
9/21/16, 9:19 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Absolutely right, Geo-economics is equally important as Geo-politics.
9/21/16, 9:21 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
9/21/16, 9:21 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Naveed East meddling in West so we have a Pakistani sandwich right now
9/21/16, 9:22 PM - Ziad Asghar: Kind of messed up strategic depth a bit.
9/21/16, 9:22 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yeah
9/21/16, 9:23 PM - Imran Farhat: Are you discussing politics ?
9/21/16, 9:23 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: oooops
9/21/16, 9:23 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: *backtracks*
9/21/16, 9:24 PM - Imran Farhat: Don't forget we guys are nearly 43 so mind you this might cause hypertension
9/21/16, 9:24 PM - Ziad Asghar: Yes, we are and remember who made the group.  Ahem.. :))
9/21/16, 9:24 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Yep. That is one of the issues. US, West, Afghan demography, China, Russia, Pak Nukes, Cen Asian energy resources, Narco trade, Iranian interests and God knows what and what not. Interplay of all these makes Afghan issue too complex.
9/21/16, 9:25 PM - Imran Farhat: Sorry admin
9/21/16, 9:25 PM - Ziad Asghar: No worries dude..
9/21/16, 9:26 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Strat depth. To be discussed face to face plz.

9/21/16, 9:31 PM - Faisal Farooqi: One day someone was singing in the class, she asked "kon gungunaya hai" and someone answered "Ataullah Khan Niazi"
9/21/16, 9:31 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Mubashar used to fly the desk in her class
9/21/16, 9:32 PM - Ziad Asghar: It was funny when someone pit the duster on top of the fan.  Abdullah Jan came in turned the fan on and it fell down.. :)

9/21/16, 9:33 PM - Nassar Nizami: Is sir Abdullah Jan still teaching?
9/21/16, 9:34 PM - Imran Farhat: No idea
9/21/16, 9:34 PM - Imran Farhat: But in fact I met him in 2009
9/21/16, 9:34 PM - Ziad Asghar: Faisal, tell them you don't want to know.
9/21/16, 9:34 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: it was funny when he would get angry look around his shoulder and then continue writing on greenboard
9/21/16, 9:34 PM - Ziad Asghar: He was a good guy..
9/21/16, 9:35 PM - Ziad Asghar: Then he would right with both right and left hand on the board..
9/21/16, 9:35 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Ziad yes. Why would we bother him of he was anything but?
9/21/16, 9:35 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: *if
9/21/16, 9:36 PM - Ziad Asghar: Exactly.. that's why we were so nice with khanzada... not!
9/21/16, 9:36 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: lol
9/21/16, 9:36 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Please remind me what Sir Leghari used to teach
9/21/16, 9:36 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: deeniyat
9/21/16, 9:37 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: his face showed total loss of hope in us
9/21/16, 9:37 PM - Ziad Asghar: haha
9/21/16, 9:51 PM - You added Ahsan Naveed Sheikh
9/21/16, 9:51 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I added Ahsan Naveed Sheikh...
9/21/16, 9:52 PM - Ahsan Naveed Sheikh: Thanks Bro
9/21/16, 9:52 PM - Faisal Farooqi: He wanted to join despite my warning of 100s of daily messages üòÉ
9/21/16, 9:53 PM - Mashood Yunus: and now he should read 10000 messages to catch up
9/21/16, 9:53 PM - Mashood Yunus: haha, sazaaaaa
9/21/16, 9:57 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Ahsan. How are you neighbour?

9/21/16, 10:06 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I was thinking about how far we have spread from a single class in AbuDhabi
9/21/16, 10:06 PM - Imran Farhat: Console him on first hand and give him the assignment to complete till max 2 hours üòÇ
9/21/16, 10:07 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Pakistan, UAE, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain, UK
9/21/16, 10:08 PM - Abdul Hafeez: ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉŸÖ Ÿàÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿ©ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá Ÿàÿ®ÿ±ŸÉÿßÿ™Ÿá  everybody...
Why do I feel about our class being unique. .. some what different than the later batch..
9/21/16, 10:09 PM - Imran Farhat: ü§î
9/21/16, 10:09 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: AbdulHafeez i agree. We were the last sign/bunch before the world went totally insane
9/21/16, 10:10 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Looking through time and the later batch.. who came later... they didn' have that something.. or should I say... they were missing something...
9/21/16, 10:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we were the last bunch who were somewhat connected with themselves  .. key point is *somewhat*
9/21/16, 10:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: it went all downhill afterwards
9/21/16, 10:12 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Exactly...
9/21/16, 10:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Brother this is a common issue of Gen X. around the world
9/21/16, 10:13 PM - Abdul Hafeez: No respect to class... teachers... not to themselves... i would say they lost being student.
9/21/16, 10:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we are the first one to juggle reality and madness at the same time
9/21/16, 10:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: the ones before us lived real lives
9/21/16, 10:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Which is is new zealand..?
9/21/16, 10:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: the ones after us lost the plot completely
9/21/16, 10:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we were in between
9/21/16, 10:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: do kushtee kay sawaar
9/21/16, 10:14 PM - Faisal Farooqi: ha, someone was paying attention. Ahsan is in Auckland
9/21/16, 10:14 PM - Ziad Asghar: I see..
9/21/16, 10:15 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Ha ha... like we knew our boundaries but never crossed it... well may be a little bit. ..
9/21/16, 10:15 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Bingo!
9/21/16, 10:15 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: spot on
9/21/16, 10:15 PM - Imran Farhat: Maybe little more than little bit
9/21/16, 10:15 PM - Ziad Asghar: Being in pakistani in UAE already meant we were traveler in 2 boats..
9/21/16, 10:15 PM - Ziad Asghar: *a
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Faisal Farooqi: True, for example so many students in our class had parents as teachers
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yep  that was  a further detriment to id crisis
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Imran Farhat: Ziyad but still we owned both boats
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Ziad Asghar: True, and that is an advantage in our dealings today.
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we are children of ppl who were mostly born during or immediately after ww2
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes
9/21/16, 10:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: absolutely
9/21/16, 10:17 PM - Ziad Asghar: We can work with anyone in the world very well.
9/21/16, 10:17 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Amen
9/21/16, 10:17 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: third culture kids
9/21/16, 10:17 PM - Ziad Asghar: Heck, most of us have multiple nationalities who work with and for us.
9/21/16, 10:17 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Living as a foreigner will have its own complexity...
But its never easy.
9/21/16, 10:18 PM - Ziad Asghar: That uae experience is key in that sense...
9/21/16, 10:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Gen X is the most severely stressed out generation
9/21/16, 10:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: caring for kids and parents
9/21/16, 10:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: The so called boomers lived for themselves
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Who is at fault? Parent or child?
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Both
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: environment
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Nassar Nizami: I envy boomers
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: lack of identity
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: lack of sense of belonging
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Yes. I agree
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: its a host of ussues
9/21/16, 10:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: issues
9/21/16, 10:20 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Gen X had authoritarian parents
9/21/16, 10:20 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: so that's part of the problem
9/21/16, 10:20 PM - Nassar Nizami: Ahsan brother, salaam
9/21/16, 10:21 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: parents were authoritarian because they were protective due to the turbulent times they themselves saw during ww2
9/21/16, 10:21 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Is that to gain and give the child what was lost during their upbringing?
9/21/16, 10:21 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes
9/21/16, 10:21 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: but they overdid
9/21/16, 10:21 PM - Abdul Hafeez: I think we all are overdoing it.
9/21/16, 10:22 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: love channelled only through criticism and anger
9/21/16, 10:22 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: no real affection
9/21/16, 10:22 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: that in itself is enough to mess up the head of kids
9/21/16, 10:23 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Abdulhafeez we have to break the cycle
9/21/16, 10:23 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: helicopter parenting is bad idea
9/21/16, 10:23 PM - Abdul Hafeez: It is..
9/21/16, 10:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: hug and hold and love your kids
9/21/16, 10:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: show affection
9/21/16, 10:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: anger whenever necessary
9/21/16, 10:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: our parents loved us
9/21/16, 10:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: but rarely showed affection
9/21/16, 10:25 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Copied for emphasis :) otherwise lost in sea of messages
9/21/16, 10:25 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: affection is a basic need of every child
9/21/16, 10:25 PM - Abdul Hafeez: I thank Allah that my parents were not 'helicoptering' but it seems that I am... somewhat...
9/21/16, 10:26 PM - Abdul Hafeez: May be we want more from our child in early age...
9/21/16, 10:26 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes that needs to be kept in check
9/21/16, 10:28 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Talk to you guys later in afternoon... Ma'Salaama
9/21/16, 10:30 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I believe we (kids) led an easy life in UAE compared to Pakistan, on the other hand our parents sacrificed a lot to build our future and enable us to get to where we are today
9/21/16, 10:31 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: that is true
9/21/16, 10:31 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: but kids in Pakistan were lot closer to their parents emotionally
9/21/16, 10:33 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: they had one less problem to deal with which is identity crisis and sense of belonging
9/21/16, 10:33 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: and even though living in third culture has enabled us in so msny ways
9/21/16, 10:34 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we suffer in many other ways
9/21/16, 10:34 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: for instance lack of capacity to build emotional connections
9/21/16, 10:34 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: which is  a BIG problem
9/21/16, 10:37 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Would like to discuss further but parking this for another day, getting late here and have some early meeting tomorrow
9/21/16, 10:38 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: see u later Inshallah
9/21/16, 10:42 PM - Ziad Asghar: Fausal, what's more important?
9/21/16, 10:43 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Sleep plans cancelled after the dare from Ziad üòá
9/21/16, 10:44 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: hehehe
9/21/16, 10:44 PM - Ziad Asghar: :) now we are talking...
9/21/16, 10:45 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faraz Rauf is here
9/21/16, 10:45 PM - Faraz Kashif: I saw him not a month ago still at the our school
Will share some pics later inshallah 

Let me catchup with the rest of the messages

I am laughing my ass off now.
People would think i am crazy

But i feel like I am sitting in the second row right behind Naveed,
Ziad, Aqeel, and others
And listening to all the chatter

It is just like we are in high school.
9/21/16, 10:46 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üéâ
9/21/16, 10:50 PM - Waseem Choudry: Aoa kya hal hai brothers
9/21/16, 10:50 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: these millennial are mostly the spoilt kids of the super arrogant baby boomers
9/21/16, 10:50 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: wasalam waseem
9/21/16, 10:57 PM - Faraz Kashif: Salaam Waseem and all others who I may have missed calling out
9/21/16, 10:58 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Ziad is online also
9/21/16, 10:58 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yes I saw him too 
üòÅüòÅ
9/21/16, 11:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Who is ^?
9/21/16, 11:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: I just see a smiley icon.
9/21/16, 11:34 PM - Haroon Yousuf: üòÇ
9/21/16, 11:38 PM - Faraz Kashif: When I walked up on him....
*Sir Abdullah Jan* was addressing  teachers before the start of new school year.
I peeked thru the glass in the door and the first glimpse he had of me, forced him to jog his memory.

He continued addressing the teachers not recognising at first.

Than it hit him hard.
HE stopped and started starring at me again.

I hesitated to introduce myself 
Kept a sweet smile on my face the whole time.

He than opened the door and said you are Kashif ??
I confirmed 

He hugged me,  kissed my neck and introduced me to the group of his teachers.

I realised that while starring at me he was not only trying to recall who I was but as if his young teaching days just flashed before his eyes 

He was remembering himself being young *thru me*

I saw an old man being jolted with memoire's of his young age 
His eyes started watering, immediately looked away and collected himself.

I knew he is still teaching there so I  took a gift for him.
The moment i handed it to him he just couldnt control it anymore.
I saw tears rolling down his face with a smile.

I realised how previous all these teachers are when he said no one  knows i am still here 
No one comes to visit me.

I hugged him and bid farewell only  to see him a few months later with more gifts for almost every one specially those with decades of  service.

I wish to do a lot more than just that.
Being away from their families and  children, our teachers did the best they could.

They will always be a part of our prayers.
9/21/16, 11:39 PM - Faraz Kashif: Faraz Mohammad Kashif

9/21/16, 11:41 PM - Faraz Kashif: Those were the days Yaar
9/21/16, 11:42 PM - Ziad Asghar: Yep, it's been a long time.. :)
9/21/16, 11:42 PM - Ziad Asghar: Good times
9/21/16, 11:43 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yes

9/22/16, 1:48 AM - Faraz Kashif: Donald Trump and Barack Obama somehow ended up at the same barbershop.

As they sat there, each being worked on by a different barber, not a word was spoken. The barbers were even afraid to start 
a conversation, for fear it would turn to politics.

As the barbers finished their shaves, the one who had Trump 
in his chair reached for the aftershave.

Trump was quick to stop him saying, 'No thanks, my wife will smell that and think I've been in a whorehouse,'

The second barber turned to Obama and said, 'How about you?'

Obama replied, 'Go ahead, my wife doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse smells like.'

üòÇüòÇ
9/22/16, 7:20 AM - Salah Khan: NCC first day and Last day.

I went for NCC in 1991. Me Mubashar Adil & Sheheryar  were on the same flight.
Any ways had to report H-9 on a certain date which I didn't and thought will go the next day. Arrived from Pabbi my village at H9 college and when entered was shocked to see all the Jawans ready in uniforms. Marta kia na karta joined them as they were announcing the squads. After a while a colonel came and was checking everyone out, came and stood next to me and gave me two hits on my arms with his stick and said "pehle hi din say shurow ho gay" I was wearing jeans and a red striped shirt. I was embarrassed and thought Khalid Saeed has followed me here too with his stick. Anyways days passed. Loads of tullaz. On 12th Aug me Adil Sherry and I guess shajee went to mury. They went back on 13th I guess and I stayed for another couple of days. Came back from mury and went to collect my NCC Certificate on the last day. Woke up, ironed my uniform, polished my boots and wore that dark green thirchi topi. Reached the college and found no one in the ground. Went to a hall and once again was stunned to see only me in uniform and the rest cadets easy in their casuals. Again met the colonel. Got my certificate with a bonus of 2 sticks and a smile. üòÄ

9/22/16, 11:15 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Offcourse ... those ingredients are only available there üòÇ
9/23/16, 1:51 AM - Faraz Kashif: Naveed,
I cant forget Muazzam, normally he acted okay but occasionally he acted spontaneously.

He got upset at something and we were walking out and from nowhere he kicked me hard on my leg  üòÅ
I felt pain for days and didnt tell anyone 
Than i said to myself he has issues and can lash out at any time without a gesture or notice

So i need to keep my distance üòÇüòÇ
We made up later
9/23/16, 2:02 AM - Faraz Kashif: Yes i met Qutab back in 1994 in Orlando

I drove from Texas all the way to Orlando
Adeel had left for Pakistan so it was only him and his roommates 

Qutab set me up for an argument with his room mates intentionally over a religious topic üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I said to myself *if i dont let them lead in this argument, I would find myself sleeping tonight inside the car, which could be challenging*

Qutab was giggling all the while in the background.

We settled our differences and I let them have the upper hand and than after dinner over tea I called Qutab *CHIRANDI*
he asked what is that

I told him thats you 
Chirandain karna aap ki Fitraat may hay, yeh aap bhi change nahi kar saktay

He confessed he is a bit naughty
I said naughty is a nice word 
Chirandi is the right word

He laughed his ass off üòÇüòÇüòÇ
When he realised what it meant.
We stayed up all night sharing memories.
9/23/16, 2:16 AM - Faraz Kashif: Yum yum

9/23/16, 1:37 PM - Faraz Kashif: üòäüòä
9/23/16, 1:40 PM - Mashood Yunus: I know we are doing it in good humour going back to our good old days but I would suggest a word of caution about Jokes which stereotype a particular Community ... A general message given that it is 40 plus people on this group and we come from different communities, thought processes, backgrounds
9/23/16, 1:42 PM - Mashood Yunus: My goal is absolutely not to offend anyone just a word of caution for all of us
9/23/16, 1:42 PM - Mujahid Ali: I am from kohat.. kpk

However this was not meant to offend anyone.. just a joke I received in another What's app group
9/23/16, 1:43 PM - Mashood Yunus: Thanks much brother mujahid for being understanding and not being offended
9/23/16, 1:43 PM - Mujahid Ali: I hope there aren't any sardars aroundüòÄ

Next one would be about them
9/23/16, 1:45 PM - Mashood Yunus: There arent but I hope you see the point we also have stereo typed them a lot, sadly ,  as Muslims if we do not protect the sanctity of others it also falls upon us in the long run
9/23/16, 1:46 PM - Mujahid Ali: True
9/23/16, 1:47 PM - Mujahid Ali: But so far the group is too formal and serious
9/23/16, 1:48 PM - Mujahid Ali: Just wanted to lighten things a bit
9/23/16, 1:49 PM - Mashood Yunus: True üòÇ
9/23/16, 1:49 PM - Faraz Kashif: Give it some time Inshallah it will be all fun and jokes 
It will relax a bit later I promise you
Since we all share a lot in common in our past years
9/23/16, 1:50 PM - Mashood Yunus: And I think we can get suggestions from the group how to manage this such as far as faraz has already suggested
9/23/16, 1:50 PM - Mujahid Ali: Ok agreed
9/23/16, 1:51 PM - Mashood Yunus: we can definitely find ways to enjoy our memories and company while also keeping the dignity of other communities and other people intact
9/23/16, 1:51 PM - Mashood Yunus: This group has some awesome brain power I'm pretty sure they will give us good ideas
9/23/16, 1:52 PM - Mashood Yunus: And again I want to thank you my brother being so kind and understanding of listening to another point or opinion
9/23/16, 1:53 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Hi I agree with Faraz.. dont let this group get too serious....üòú
9/23/16, 1:54 PM - Faraz Kashif: üòäüòäüíêüíêüòòüòò
9/23/16, 1:54 PM - Mujahid Ali: €åÿßÿ± ÿØŸÑ Ÿæÿ± ŸÜ€Å ŸÑŸà

9/23/16, 1:55 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yaar give each other some chummian and some hugs 
We are all in need of them

Hahhaa
9/23/16, 1:55 PM - Mashood Yunus: We can modify  jokes by replacing the word about the community with "a person" instead of a "Punjabi" or "muslim" or "sardar" or "hindu" or "pathaan" .. we can say a person .... Did so and so. I definitely do not mean to make it hard for anyone to post anything which is enjoyable but a word of caution given the world we live in ...
9/23/16, 1:55 PM - Mashood Yunus: Haha, ok br mujahid
9/23/16, 1:55 PM - Mujahid Ali: üòÄ
9/23/16, 1:56 PM - Mashood Yunus: I see the point from all three of you and I agree we don't want to be too serious inshallah we can enjoy together
9/23/16, 1:59 PM - Amir A. Sattar: Yar mujahid yad hai main aur muneer tumhara ghar par ata tha tourist club area main

9/23/16, 3:35 PM - Faraz Kashif: Me, Mohammad Ali and Salah were talking on our way back to AE that talking with no boundaries about youth days worked as a psychological therapy session

We felt relieved after soo long to be amongst our own folks that wont judge us for what we wore, how we look or what we say.

We tore down the wall, even if it was short lived, that we all have built around us to safe guard us from the harshness in this world

Anything and everything was being said üòÅüòÅ

It worked wonders for us.
Now its your turn guys üòâüòâ

9/23/16, 3:41 PM - Amir A. Sattar: Hahaha believe it or not it just happened today
9/23/16, 3:42 PM - Amir A. Sattar: And when ever you think you are going to parradise the malik angel who is guardian of hell comes in the form of you wife and tells you no bacha you are going to hell

9/23/16, 3:59 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Faraz, what you said is true. Most of us are comfortable discussing any topic with school friends....
9/23/16, 4:00 PM - Mohammad Ali: üëåüòáüò¢
9/23/16, 4:01 PM - Faisal Farooqi: A request to all members, if a topic is uncomfortable please speak up and comments like Mashood did earlier today.
9/23/16, 4:01 PM - Mashood Yunus: haha, nothing too seriousm, i would say but they way you said it Ali, ROFL, this is what you get when tyou talk to buddies from high school.  my friends here cannot relate to this.  as some of you said earlier, talking to each other is a therapy, we are gettijg so much out of our systems, as if it was waiting to be removed.  the pool therapy was at hospital to help with muscle movement.  dentist visit was the long over due, most boring visit of the life, with the flossing advise (for ever), I just got done with it so next money months I do not get reminder calls
9/23/16, 4:02 PM - Amir A. Sattar: between friends no topic is uncomfortable this is the essence of friendship
9/23/16, 4:03 PM - Haroon Yousuf: üëèüèªgreat speech Amir.üòÄ
9/23/16, 4:03 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yeah lets not *CHOKE* the potential of this group

We may say things here that we cant say anywhere to anyone.

I am sure we all know our boundaries very well

It will all settle down soon Since the lids just came off 

Let them have at it üòäüòä
9/23/16, 4:03 PM - Amir A. Sattar: if you guyz would apply cencor to every thing than i think i will be better facing my wifeüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
9/23/16, 4:04 PM - Mashood Yunus: br how about our wives, for all 40 of us :)
9/23/16, 4:04 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Mashood get some extra phone batteries.... Cant let you off the chat board....
9/23/16, 4:05 PM - Mashood Yunus: hehe, haroon,  i might be the first person then who might have to be censored, chained, controlled and finally kicked out
9/23/16, 4:06 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Agree with you Amir. However with passage of time we have developed varied opinion and thoughts. Forum discussions do not convey the demeanour so there is a chance of taking offense. All I am saying is that please do not take offense and instead just speak up to change subject if the need arises.
9/23/16, 4:06 PM - Haroon Yousuf: No sir. You my friend have single handedly led this group by I think 6000 messagesüòúüòú
9/23/16, 4:06 PM - Mashood Yunus: uf harooon,
9/23/16, 4:06 PM - Mashood Yunus: the sad reality, this is one of the reason, I can be kicked out ,... you know
9/23/16, 4:07 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Haha.. No I think we all enjoy you texting..
9/23/16, 4:07 PM - Mashood Yunus: I am back home in USA and trying to settle and find all batteries etc but imagine, if I can type 6000 messages (your exaggeration) from canada, what can I do from my home in USA?
9/23/16, 4:07 PM - Faisal Farooqi: There should be a message leaderboard üòÄ
9/23/16, 4:08 PM - Faraz Kashif: *GROUP - MODERATORS*
9/23/16, 4:09 PM - Mashood Yunus: haha,  I scare myself as I am enjoying these awesome discussions with you all so much.  Let us hope, i better find a job and get busy so I can only type 2 lines in a day, hehehe  and yes, I know you all enjoyed texting but I am so glad ... balcouchi, faraz kashif and few other didn't have to read my non stop text ...
9/23/16, 4:09 PM - Mashood Yunus: last message was responding to Haroon :)
9/23/16, 4:09 PM - Maqbool Islam: <Media omitted>

9/23/16, 4:11 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Amir doesn't know of your texting powers yet....but will hopefully experience soon....
9/23/16, 4:11 PM - Maqbool Islam: Second is Shahjehan a junior fellow
9/23/16, 4:12 PM - Mohammad Ali: But here, let's talk about us the way we like.
9/23/16, 4:13 PM - Mashood Yunus: I absolutely agree with Ali on this Faisal.  that one line did the trick.  given that we really want to be ourselves, but at the same time, do not want to get out of "SELF" censoring.  It is so easy to get carried away and I have been most guilty of it at times, I just cannot have enough of texting with you all although I do not know at least 10 people on this board.
9/23/16, 4:13 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I don't think we have or need any admins here either üòÄ
9/23/16, 4:13 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Self control is the way to go üëçüèº

9/25/16, 9:17 AM - Mohammad Ali: A nice Article by Amitabh Bachchan....
What is the difference between
your mother and wife..
They both LOVE us,
Both SACRIFICE for us,
Both make us EAT
more than we require,
Both make our
house into HOME,
Both PRAY for us,
Both are ALWAYS
there for us,
Both LIVE for us
then why do...
we post/say funny jokes about wife and Laugh & always post respectable quote for mother... The only difference i can see is one brings you into the world... and other makes YOU her world, but men always take their wives for granted & often ignore them in important talks, matters,decisions, Plannings etc...because they think that they are in-efficient to handle them...
Dear men it's True that your mother sacrifices to make you become a Leader but a wife sacrifices to maintain your Leadership... your mother gets your affection and care throughout her Life:but a wife gets your full attention only when she is near the end of her Life... waiting to get your Certification of her soulmate... Please give her importance in early age of her Life so that she can feel that she is not only the Princess of her father but also the Queen of her husband...

Needs self-realisation to begin that journey
9/25/16, 6:11 PM - Faraz Kashif: Good to know we have a guy who only studied for a short time with us = *Saif* and that he is happy to be a part of this group and remembers us

9/25/16, 9:46 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Faisal there was an O LEVELS class also run on our school for few months I believe. Some of us joined that - not me. 
It was later reversed after that stupid decision of matric in Urdu was reversed. 
And we remerged. This happened in 8th I think.
9/25/16, 9:50 PM - Imran Farhat: Yes Naveed that's right
9/25/16, 9:50 PM - Faisal Farooqi: correct, I was in the O'level class. My first encounter with Sir Razatullah and his actions to pick a student, call him in front and then bow so he can hit/punish on the back    üòÇ

Mashhud got clever and bribed you with a sweet innocent lovely voice, and you gave us all your second *DELIGHT* üòä

üòú

A Father put his 3year old daughter to bed, told her a story and listened to her prayers which ended by saying, 
"God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa."

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, "I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do."

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, "God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma."

The next day the grandmother died.

"Holy crap" thought the father, "this kid is in contact with the other side."

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, "God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy."

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, "I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?"

He said, "I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life."

She said, "You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting!"

9/27/16, 7:09 AM - Mashood Yunus: People complained then and will complain now that it was best or not ... quality has gone down but I assure, years later, the same quality is considered good enough :)  in bigger picture and context, probably things are not so same and similar but so are NOT our circumstances, resources, political situations (being an embassy school) etc etc.

Any opinions..... Please comment. Waiting
9/28/16, 6:21 AM - Farrukh Eijaz: HOW TO INSTALL HUSBAND :

A woman writes to the IT Technical support Guy :-

Dear Tech Support,
Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and I noticed a distinct slowdown in the overall system performance. This is particularly in the flower and jewellery applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0! 

In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled another
valuable program, Romance 9.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as NEWS 5.0, MONEY 3.0 and CRICKET 4.1

What can I do? 
Rgds 
Xxxx 

Reply :

Dear Madam,
First, keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment  Package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.

Please enter command- ithoughtyoulovedme.html and try to download Tears 6.2 , then only it will automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5

However, remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Silence 2.5 , Beer 6.1 or Whisky 6.8

Also DO NOT disturb the original package of Husband 1.0 Otherwise new virus Girlfriend 2.5 will automatically be downloaded into your system. 
So please be careful! 

In addition, please do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. 
These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0

We recommend: Cooking 3.0

Good Luck Madam !
Rgds

9/28/16, 9:32 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Imran, you are sleeping on US cycle
9/28/16, 9:33 PM - Faisal Farooqi: You can honorary rep for US team in the audio sessions
9/28/16, 9:34 PM - Imran Farhat: Halaal fun sessions üòÇ
But I think we should avoid saying competition , and start saying participation as we have many singers who are not pros but awesome and can participate with atleast a song for their  friends.
9/28/16, 9:35 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Rawalpindi/Islamabad folks, UAE team is already gearing up for 2nd get together..... you need to plan a gathering soon to keep up
9/28/16, 9:36 PM - Imran Farhat: üò¨
9/28/16, 9:39 PM - Mashood Yunus: agreed Imran - it has to be "competitive participation" though?  no? yes?  or shoudl we just leave it at participation ...
9/28/16, 9:44 PM - Mashood Yunus: insha-Allah requesting you all to make some special dua.  Trump has made this year hard (like every election year is hard politically) but this year is especially hard
9/28/16, 9:45 PM - Waseem Choudry: Salam to everyone brothers
9/28/16, 9:46 PM - Mashood Yunus: there are special sessions coming up such as "Knowing your somali neighbour" or "knowing your Muslim Neighbour" - starting tomorrow, every Thursday for 9 weeks ... may Allah guide us to speak with patience and knowledge
9/28/16, 9:48 PM - Mashood Yunus: last week an attack happened in a city close by to where I live so these sessions will have extra effort now given that attack happened in this state.  although there is experience of these sessions, it is going to get extra hard this year .  Minnesotans are generally very nice people but it is also their right to get honest answers, insha-Allah
9/28/16, 9:48 PM - Mashood Yunus: wa-Alaikum assalam waseem
9/28/16, 9:49 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Surah AlKahf brother.  Its all downhill.
9/28/16, 9:50 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: May Allah reward ur efforts
9/28/16, 9:52 PM - Mashood Yunus: this is where the collective dua is most important.  our efforts with our dua together insha-Allah.  One of the positives from Trump's lies is that evangelical christians, who are one of the hardest group to engage, are now willing to engage.  They are different than mainstream christianity but sadly are quite involved politically.  There are good chances to build bridges because they have seen the outright lies where Muslims are presented as Devil by certain republicans and definitely some in the Trumps' camp
9/28/16, 9:55 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood all this is a charade.  What they intend to do is a done deal already. Thats why I said  Surah Al Kahf.
9/28/16, 9:55 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood.. JazakAllah for all you are doing...
9/28/16, 9:56 PM - Shakil Ahmed: May Allah make it easy for the group...
9/28/16, 9:56 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: The bankers ponzi scheme is falling apart. Their options are limited. Severely limited.
9/28/16, 9:57 PM - Mashood Yunus: true aqeel .. but we have to do our part, esp. for the people of consious (regarless of religion) who want to make a difference for a peaceful society.  if we will not do our part, we will be responsible as well.
9/28/16, 9:57 PM - Mashood Yunus: thanks much shakeel.
9/28/16, 9:57 PM - Mashood Yunus: so dua is needed as matters of the world are such, no matter where we live all of us, in all religious are impacted but specially muslims and christians
9/28/16, 9:58 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood very true. Keep up your efforts . Read Surah Alkahf and try to wake up Muslims.  Danger lies ahead
9/28/16, 9:59 PM - Mashood Yunus: yes insha-Allah.  wake up myself as well :)  alhamdulillah Surah Kahf ... is huge help.
9/28/16, 9:59 PM - Shakil Ahmed: read surah Alam Nashrah... and Dua... rabbi ishrah li sadri wa yassir li amri .... yafqahoo qauli...
9/28/16, 10:00 PM - Mashood Yunus: in case if any body wants to read details, here is a link - https://hopkins.ce.feepay.com/course/fall-adult-2016/know-your-somali-neighbor
9/28/16, 10:02 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: the presence of two hawks clearly indicates a major conflict is on the table for the bankers. They are up against the wall themselves
9/28/16, 10:02 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah save humanity
9/28/16, 10:03 PM - Mashood Yunus: ameen
9/28/16, 10:03 PM - Imran Farhat: Ameen
9/28/16, 10:03 PM - Shakil Ahmed: aameen
9/28/16, 10:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: in th end nothing is difficult for Allah
9/28/16, 10:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], Allah extinguished it. And they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and Allah does not like corrupters. Surah Al Maidah 64
9/28/16, 10:12 PM - Amer Aslam: <Media omitted>
9/28/16, 10:20 PM - Amer Aslam: Mashood it's easy choice. 

Trump has made it easy for everyone. 

Com on what do u expect when u pit a monkey against someone , naturally people ll go something rational something human looking and talking atleast , doesn't matter a man or woman, u know. 

This is the easiest elections. 

I mean it always is. Bud they already know who is coming n who is going. 

The only aim is to have something like trump that's so abnoxious like him to b there so people following there natural instincts would go the other way. 


It's that simple.
9/28/16, 10:20 PM - Amer Aslam: This Whatsapp autocorrect messes up everything I noticed.

9/29/16, 12:18 AM - Mashood Yunus: This picture is way too funny
9/29/16, 12:45 AM - Ziad Asghar: Nice, so what is the summary of the last 600 messages?  Urdu exam for you guys.
9/29/16, 12:45 AM - Ziad Asghar: Good to see Amer here as well.
9/29/16, 12:50 AM - Mashood Yunus: Entry of amer aslam brought the same awesome excitement from him as every new person in the group has shown. Shakeel and saif spent some awesome time with each other, teasing each other in a very ÿ®ÿß ÿßÿØÿ® way.  Ahmer and aqeel kept adoring each other while inaam provided comic relief.  M Ali butt was extra ordinarily bayhudah ÿ®€í €ÅŸàÿØ€Å today. Imran farhat was his usual awesome self.  I cannot summerize audio messages, they are way too cool to summerize. U listen to them
9/29/16, 12:54 AM - Mashood Yunus: Oh and amir baloch was so so awesome with his singing (mostly halaal) but quite ⁄ÜŸê⁄æ⁄Ü⁄æŸàÿ±ÿß in his audio messages (it seems no one expects otherwise). Haroon bring in that exuberant energy, naveed stopped by to drop THAT one line. I mostly watched from sidelines today.
9/29/16, 12:55 AM - Ziad Asghar: So another wild day in this group.. ")
9/29/16, 12:55 AM - Ziad Asghar: :)
9/29/16, 12:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: Oh shehryaar and muneer brought two "useful" posting in this otherwise "useless" group.
9/29/16, 12:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes ... ⁄©ÿ®⁄æ€å ⁄©€í ÿØŸÜ ŸÑŸÖÿ®€íÿå ⁄©ÿ®⁄æ€å ⁄©€å ÿ±ÿßÿ™€å⁄∫
9/29/16, 12:59 AM - Mashood Yunus: Faraz kashif was wild as usual, m Ali butt was also impacted by the ⁄ÜÿßŸÑŸà language of amer aslam.  Asif iqbal and couple more guys provided cool conversations...  this group did serve.its purpose today too
9/29/16, 12:59 AM - Mohammad Ali: üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëç
9/29/16, 1:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: See ali is being ÿ®ÿØÿ™ŸÖ€åÿ≤ÿå again. You should listen to his audio messages alone, and note the tone, as if he was the teenager  ready for tullaa
9/29/16, 1:02 AM - Mashood Yunus: Oho sorry, this last posting by Ali is not his. It is the very baa adab one from shakil. Ali is just appreciating, how nice shakil is while Ali wishes to be that cool
9/29/16, 1:08 AM - Ziad Asghar: Cool.  Isn't it Late your time.

There are many guises for intelligence.

One part of you is gliding in a high windstream,

while your ore ordinary notions

take little steps and peck at the ground.

Conventional knowledge is death to our souls,

and it is not really ours. It is laid on.

Yet we keep saying we find ‚Äòrest‚Äô in these ‚Äòbeliefs‚Äô.

We must become ignorant of what we have been taught

and be instead bewildered.

Run from what is profitable and comfortable.

Distrust anyone who praises you.

Give your investment money, and the interest

on the capital, to those who are actually destitute.

Forget safety. Live where you fear to live.

Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.

I have tried prudent planning long enough.

From now on, I‚Äôll be mad.

‚Äì Rumi

But the shaer is not the tafseer of the aya. It is an resembles of the situation which have fallen upon the Muslim Umma these days.

The actual decending of people of Yajouj and Majouj is going to be something far far horrific than what the present situation is.
9/29/16, 6:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hafeez read verse number 95
9/29/16, 6:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: u know better arabic than me
9/29/16, 6:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the word Hatta is a conjunction
9/29/16, 6:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: connecting two parts of a sentence
9/29/16, 6:05 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: in this case connecting verse 95 and 96
9/29/16, 6:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hatta is a word that connects two events in chronological order in this particular case
9/29/16, 6:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: one leads to another
9/29/16, 6:11 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Verse 95 )   And there is prohibition upon [the people of] a city which We have destroyed that they will [ever] return

This verse provides the fact the any nation destroyed will never return.
But Yajouj and Majouj were never destroyed.
9/29/16, 6:12 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: There are a people that were kicked out twice and then there was ban
9/29/16, 6:12 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: almost 2000 years until they finally made their way back in 1948
9/29/16, 6:13 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: to claim it as their own
9/29/16, 6:13 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Hatta is .... "untill" they are released... and then they will be destroyed.
9/29/16, 6:13 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Star of David is a blatant symbol of that possession
9/29/16, 6:14 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes Hatta is until
9/29/16, 6:14 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the ppl wont be able to return until gog magog are released
9/29/16, 6:14 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: they are back
9/29/16, 6:14 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: in 1948
9/29/16, 6:15 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: twice banu israel were destroyed
9/29/16, 6:15 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Babylonians
9/29/16, 6:15 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: romans
9/29/16, 6:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and the ban lifted after 2000 years
9/29/16, 6:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and they are back
9/29/16, 6:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: in 1948
9/29/16, 6:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Yansiloon
9/29/16, 6:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: spreading out
9/29/16, 6:17 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: they spread out long time ago
9/29/16, 6:17 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: so much so that one of them had the sun always shining bright 24/7
9/29/16, 6:18 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: this hasnt happened since Zul Qarnain
9/29/16, 6:18 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: but Zul Qarnain used power to punish oppressors
9/29/16, 6:18 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: but these ppl are Mufsidoon fil ard
9/29/16, 6:19 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Tabaria is dry already
9/29/16, 6:20 AM - Abdul Hafeez: If we check the real history... we see Jews were kicked out more than two times... I know some interpretation of aya in Sura Bani Israel is relating to destruction of Bani Israel twice but that is the case here.

The aya in Sura Anmbiya is not mentioning the Bani Isreal only.. here its giving a general term for all nation destroyed.
9/29/16, 6:20 AM - Abdul Hafeez: * not the case
9/29/16, 6:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: thats an interpretation
9/29/16, 6:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: i gave u another
9/29/16, 6:22 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Oh The Beloved wants you to work hard to find what He is planning sometimes
9/29/16, 6:22 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and something this epic..oh He wont give it away easy
9/29/16, 6:22 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: :)
9/29/16, 6:23 AM - Amer Aslam: https://youtu.be/2kZd3lTp2bc
9/29/16, 6:24 AM - Amer Aslam: Really good spot on.
9/29/16, 6:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and another to remember is the clarity we might have today is not because of our intelligence but simply due to the fact that we see history unfold infront of us which the previous generations couldnt
9/29/16, 6:24 AM - Amer Aslam: Aslamu alaiqum Abdul hafeez aqeel.
9/29/16, 6:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: wa alikum assalam
9/29/16, 6:24 AM - Amer Aslam: Don't watch absorb it.

9/29/16, 6:32 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Alhamdulillah
9/29/16, 6:32 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Bro Aqeel
We should do a small research with hadiths in Saheehain (Bukhari and Muslim) and try to avoid interpretations done by online Shiekhs whom I have no sound knowledge of his background.

Pls do not mistaken me.
But I need more clarification  before I judge them to be authentic.
9/29/16, 6:32 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... that was a great summary you gave to Ziad....  don't spoil him....

9/29/16, 6:35 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Amir Aslam.... great to see you again... as Mashhood requested, please post your photo..
9/29/16, 6:35 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: verse 95 and 96 if interpreted this way make more sense than any other interpretation
9/29/16, 6:36 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood I was oct 1972 or Feb 1973 ...
9/29/16, 6:37 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel and Abdul Hafeez... nice discussion going on... will go over it later...

10/1/16, 1:59 AM - Salman Agha: Ur cell phone number conveys ur age.

We dont know who invented this formula. It is wonderful and un believabie.

Whether it is right or wrong u can try with ur cell phone number with the following procedure.

1) take last digit of ur cell number

2) multiply that number by 2

3) add 5 to the number arrived at

4) multiply that number by 50

5) add 1766 to the number u got

6) subtract ur year of birth from the number so obtained

7) u will get 3 digits number. The first is ur cell phone number's last digit and other two numbers r ur age.

Amazing!!!!!!

10/1/16, 4:08 AM - Waseem Choudry: ```Class for today...
Read it and tell me if you think the punishment part is right, we all know that not offering our prayers (salat) is HARAM! But little do we know the punishments that we will face...
Why do we erase messages that talk about religious (Islam) matters! 
But We resend ordinary messages? 

The Prophet peace be upon him narrated.
"Convey from me, even if its one verse (Ayah)" 
Maybe forwarding this message to others can be beneficial for your Intercession on the Day of Judgement.

The punishments of the one who doesn't pray.

The Prophet peace be upon him narrated: "Whoever shows heedlessness (negligence) in praying salat, Allah punishes them with fifteen kinds of punishments"

Six punishments in this lifetime.
Three punishments while dying.
Three punishments in the grave.
Three punishments on the day of Judgment.

Six punishments in this lifetime:
1 - Allah takes away blessings from his age,(makes his life misfortunate)
2 - Allah wipes out the virtues of righteous people from his face.
3 - Allah does not accept his Dua's.
4- He will be detested by all creatures on Earth.
5 - Allah does not award him for his good deeds.
6 - He will not be included in the prayer & Dua's of the righteous.
(good people)

Three punishments while dying.
1- He dies humiliated.
2-He dies hungry.
3- He dies thirsty. 
Even if he drinks the water of all the seas, he will still be thirsty.

Three punishments in the grave.
1- Allah tightens his grave until his chest, ribs come over each other.
2- Allah pours on him fire with embers (red colour, hot coal made of immensely heated firewood).
3- Allah sets on him a snake called "The Brave" "The Bold" which rolls all around his body & crushes him. 

Three punishments on the day of Judgment.
1- He will be dragged face down over hot burning coal to the hellfire.
2- Allah gives him an angry look that makes the flesh of his face fall down
3- Allah judges him strictly and orders him to be thrown in hell.

Those who do not offer their prayers of:

FAJR: 
The glow of their face is taken away.

DHUHR: 
The blessing of their income is taken away (even if he has millions, he will be poor).

ASR: 
There is no strength in their body.

MAGHRIB: 
They are not benefitted by their children.

ISHA: 
The peace of their sleep is taken away.

Select + copy + paste + send = The great reward of Allah.
It's your choice...!!!

The person who listens to music during the Adhan will be unable to recite the Shahadah while dying.

If you don't spread d knowledge, then it is your sins that stopped you 4rm doing so.
Please forward this & let us all get the reward.
Don't say "0k"

Don't say "wow"

Don't say "great"

10/1/16, 1:44 PM - Faraz Kashif: Women in our culture need it more than we do
They spent their lives taking care of the little ones 
These man made structures have given my mom claustrophobia

Its a daunting challenge now
10/1/16, 1:45 PM - Ziad Asghar: Wow, definitely has an impact on people.  They have made UAE into a concrete jungle with building so close to each other.

10/1/16, 1:53 PM - Ziad Asghar: Fraz, no doubt about it and the problem is that when they get old, they have to change their entire life and move away on retirement.
10/1/16, 1:54 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yes indeed 
No solid home 
No sense of belonging 
We got it too
Whether we realise it or not
10/1/16, 1:54 PM - Amir A. Sattar: <Media omitted>
10/1/16, 1:54 PM - Ziad Asghar: Retirement is difficult any way but to have to move away from friends and the life you have lived is eveb more difficult.

10/1/16, 3:01 PM - Asif Iqbal: *Pls share to other groups*
This is to awaken our security consciousness!!!.
A true life story is told of how armed robbers are snatching from unsuspecting people their vehicles nowadays.
In a wedding party or public gathering, they will meet the MC to make an announcement of a particular car with registration number so so and so, blocking them.
While you go out to move your car, some guys are waiting outside for you with a gun. They know you have the keys of your car.
You are then ordered to ride the car out of the compound with them inside already with you.
Please, Do the following when your vehicle registration number is being called out at a social function :
1) Take your time before going out.
2) Don't go out alone, at least in company of two or more people.
(3) Don't go directly to where the car is parked, at least to confirm from a distance if you are blocking another car truly.
And make sure there is a driver in the blocked car already before you go.
4) Watch your surroundings carefully before approaching the vehicle
Please copy and share even if u don't own a car and save a lot of people.

10/1/16, 9:53 PM - Mashood Yunus: Now, I know that things are hard for us right now but thi remind myself and if u find this of value, please take it otherwise u can ignore me.  for people of trust in God, These are the moments where we need to remain as close to our objective as possible without sounding racist, ignorant and abusive. These are the moments where we call for Allahs help the most as our purpose is message of One God (like zia ul haq reminded rajeev gandhi).  Islam is direct threat to shaytan and all tools of shaytan need to be nullified. However matters in this world only happen by Allahs will and His will is with patient ones and those who remain steadfast (surah asr). He loves the right means to be used for right causes. Inshallah we will not resort to racism, swearing and offensive gesturing but remain steadfast with Allah with dua and good manners.

Azan per pabendi laga Dee gayee , jub logon nay shor Kiya to us nay kaha k Turkish may azan do. 

Hata k Quran Shareef Ko Bhi Turkish translation may allow Kiya Gaya. ( saray ulema is baat per mutefiq hein k Quran Shareef Ka khali terjuma asel Quran Shareef nhin).

10/2/16, 12:19 AM - Mashood Yunus: Br amer  .. I agree with you 100% .... Since Muslims themselves have such difference of opinion on such matters, social media doesnt work very well as a platform but you have spoken the truth. Br ahmer had mentioned that he wants to avoid argument, I suggest to move further discussion to a private chat and if u both agree, feel free to add me to that chat
10/2/16, 12:20 AM - Amer Aslam: Ahmer pay fine ho chuka hai treat Ka. Case closed.

10/2/16, 4:16 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I think it is best to keep reporting of political issues out as well. This is how discussions start

10/2/16, 4:19 PM - Faisal Farooqi: This forum best serves its purpose if everyone from our class is on it. Easy way to contact everyone with a single message and to keep up to date on general happenings.
10/2/16, 4:19 PM - Amer Aslam: Oküëå
10/2/16, 4:19 PM - Amer Aslam: üòâ
10/2/16, 4:20 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Providing entertainment was not the goal but rather a side effect of the music hour etc üòÇ
10/2/16, 4:20 PM - Amer Aslam: Hmmm
10/2/16, 4:21 PM - Faisal Farooqi: We already have had 5 members leave for one reason or another (one was convinced to rejoin)
10/2/16, 4:21 PM - Amer Aslam: Kon waqeyee.

10/2/16, 4:29 PM - Mashood Yunus: But I am so happy he is keeping us so engaged. He is our glue.
10/2/16, 4:31 PM - Mashood Yunus: The best thing so many people on this group seem to really relte to him. Amer is a very popular group mmber mashallah. Baaqi jub milain gay to khabar lain gay iski.  I just returned nd from classes and there were only 20 messages from all day
10/2/16, 4:31 PM - Mashood Yunus: About topicw ... Is there a reason, this group doesnt discuss cricket at all?
10/2/16, 4:34 PM - Imran Farhat: We have limited options for our priority is to keep the group intact
10/2/16, 4:34 PM - Mashood Yunus: Not that I love the  fazool game but Pakistanis are often dead busy discussing cricket but it is quite a missing topic on this forum
10/2/16, 4:34 PM - Mashood Yunus: Hmm. Will cricket make people leave the group too?
10/2/16, 4:35 PM - Imran Farhat: I was following it all the way but that is not a topic to raise in the group
10/2/16, 4:36 PM - Mashood Yunus: Oho achaa, are people taht sensitive to.cricket?
10/2/16, 4:36 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Our team is such a lost cause that no one wants to talk about it üò•
10/2/16, 4:37 PM - Imran Farhat: It will go lije yaar amir nay fazzol bowlinh karaye phor dusro ball pay chokka khaya or tisri ball wide karadi and soo on 
1 over will take like atleast six messages üòÇüòÇ
10/2/16, 4:38 PM - Mashood Yunus: I think having sub groups will be in favour of faisal and ziad, jab bhi koi fazool topic charay, faisal and ziad can tell people to join that group and some of us can become moderators of controversial topic
10/2/16, 4:38 PM - Imran Farhat: But i don't think there is any harm discussing cricket by the way
10/2/16, 4:39 PM - Mashood Yunus: Ok. But your example was so funny ... It will exactly go like that. Kaafi laan taan ho gee her cricketer per ...
10/2/16, 4:40 PM - Mashood Yunus: Faisal .. Aaj kal to kaafi mehnat ker raheajn hay bechaaray.
10/2/16, 4:40 PM - Mashood Yunus: Younis khan to chaaya huwa hay.
10/2/16, 4:40 PM - Mashood Yunus: Acha, here are sample names of faisal and ziad sub groups ...
10/2/16, 4:41 PM - Imran Farhat: ü§î will be good isn't it?
It will be like if i wake up with a bad mood i will start discussing politics .
If i wake up early for Fajar prayers i will join Islamic discussions. 
And so on but i think the best one will be this but only between 2am to 6am UAE time üòú

10/4/16, 4:23 AM - Imran Sohail: Adnan, 
I do not wish to start with the term "Dear" or "son", because I do not wish to acknowledge that you're either of those for me. I am a miserable soul and I do not wish to increase my torment here. 
Mr. Adnan, let me introduce myself to you, because you seem to have forgotten it all. Let me refresh your arrogance - fogged memory. 
I, am a Pakistan Air Force officer. I am the youngest recipient of Sitara Jurat. I am the recipient of the Medal of Honor from Iran, Turkey and Jordan. The Kings of these countries sought to honor me for my services. I am the recipient of multiple gallantry awards including the SJ and Sitara e Imtiaz, because I fought for my country in the 1965 war, valiantly so. I served three presidents as Aide de camp in my service, and I was taken up into foreign services after my retirement from the Airforce to represent my beloved land across the world. I made it to the 22nd grade, upto the post of Commissioner General, the first, I might add. 
Let me indulge deeper into flashback. When you were young and had a taste for music, I bought you your first Piano. You learnt to play and I was very proud of you. I arranged for you to travel across the country to different PAF bases in military aircrafts, requesting their base commanders to let you perform. They took you in with open arms, because of what your father meant to them. That, is where you started your music career from, performing in military bases, travelling on the expense of the PAF, who applauded you for your talents and provided you with opportunities.  
Coming back to the 1965 war that made your father who he was. The enemy was upon us. We were a few skilled men, and we had the weight of our country's entire population on our young shoulders. We gave it everything we had and we succeeded. Let me be clear; that was my country's debt on me. I was chosen for this honor, I owed my land more than my singular life. 
The enemy that I spoke of, Adnan, was the last five letters on your current address. It was the loathsome colors on the flag you hold. It was the anthem that you now believe in. It was the sound of oppression, the conflict of ideology and the arch nemesis of my beloved motherland. 
Soldiers, Adnan, think differently than you liberated and self centered men. For us, it is the sound of our anthem that brings us peace, the sight of our flag that brings us tranquility and the scent of our earth, that fuels our will to live. I cannot describe in any sufficient words how much my country means to me. 
The land that you proudly proclaim to be your home, is the land your unfortunate father almost died fighting against. The enmity between your home and mine is so deep rooted and so traumatizing, it is unimaginably treacherous to have even thought about creating a soft corner for the murderer of hundreds and thousands of our brothers, sisters, parents and children. And you, in pursuit of worldly gains (atleast that's what your incentive was) stepped on your father's name and repute to get to the other side. My blood is on the border that you crossed, Adnan. My friends in heaven heard you say Jai Hind. I thanked God in person, that He did not keep me alive to witness that moment. That he didn't make me stay long enough to exclaim your love for the armed forces that have killed my fellow soldiers. 
The world remembers me in honorable mentions. But I think I brought myself the worst disgrace that the universe has to offer. I brought you into this world, and whatever I may proclaim, you will always be a cancerous part of me. Deteriorating my honor, you will always be my deepest regret. 
Your miserable father, 
Sqn Ldr Arshad Sami 
SJ, SI(M)

10/4/16, 7:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: here is some added inspiration
10/4/16, 8:02 AM - Shakil Ahmed: ok all.... please pray for my friend... Niaz Malik.... he is going back to Pakistan today. . he got two months therapy....  a little better... but still paralysis whole body from neck down
10/4/16, 8:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: May Allah cure him
10/4/16, 8:03 AM - Shakil Ahmed: you never know what comes up next.... we all planned for years.  and then boom!.
10/4/16, 8:03 AM - Shakil Ahmed: he was the next CEO of Zong Pakistan....
10/4/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòï
10/4/16, 8:12 AM - Shakil Ahmed: ok thanks... I am going to do half day today... and then going to airport to see him off
10/4/16, 8:12 AM - Mashood Yunus: Br imran, I am very grateful for this letter. Increasingly many of these singing and dancing type of people from our land are heard saying ours and indias culture and food is same, music is same and some of them even throw holi and diwali parties in pakistan. Sadly most of them.are.the rich brats. People like adnan sami, you were genius in pakistan but become so beghairat eventually, remind me of blessings of Allah. Some people of his background become Junaid jamshed (who begs for forgiveness when he makes a mistake) and others become him. None are perfect but both chose opposite paths. Yet in between there are many, who sit like a munaafiq. May the current situation open the eyes of such in the middle as we keep reading how they want to benefit financially from india.  Thx again for this mesmirizing letter ... While my love for pakistan will never cross my love for my Deen and my rab, every time I hear the sincerity in  raheel shareef saheb or asim bajwa mentioning islam in their speeches, I find solace in the fact that our brave forces still extract their jazbaa from their imaan (and aqeedah) in Islamic theology and there are still those who remember pakistan was not built on racism but.rather.to.protect our belief in One God so we can succeed in this world with Tauheed.  Alhamdulillah.  Thx again for this mesmirizing letter which made my day, my brother(s)
10/4/16, 8:12 AM - Shakil Ahmed: getting back to work...
10/4/16, 8:25 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... great comments.... I really agree that Pakistan and Indian cultures are not same.. food is not same..music is not same... dress is not same... customs are not same.... so I don't know what these people are drinking who say they are same..... but being different doesn't have to be sole basis of enmity.... there should be mutual respect and tolerance..... and Islam teaches us that and Prophets SAWS sunnah practiced it
10/4/16, 8:31 AM - Mashood Yunus: True shakil, if such people can be that clear as you mention, this forms the important basis of understanding why we came to this.world.  respect is God given right for every soul in this test of life and defeating shaytaan is most important goal.

10/5/16, 5:41 PM - Saifullah Inayat: üîπWhen you die don't worry... üò¢ 
üîπDon't be concerned over your decaying body.. üò¢
 
üë• Because the Muslims will take care of what is required..  üëà

They will.. 

1 - Strip you of your clothes 
2 - Wash you
3 - Shroud you
4 - Take you out of your home...
5 - ... to your new place of stay (the grave) 

6 - Many will come to bid farewell at your funeral - infact many will cancel work for the sake of your burial, even though most of them didn't think to about advising you even once whilst you were alive..

7- Your belongings will be gotten rid of:
üîπyour keys
üîπyour books
üîπyour bags
üîπyour shoes 
üîπyour clothes

üëà If your family are wise, they will give it to charity so that it may benefit you (in your record of good deeds)

And be assured..‚òù 

That this dunya will not grieve over you üëà
 Nor will the world üëà

üëà And the economy will continue..

üëà  Your job, someone else will take your position

üëà Your wealth will go to your inheritors 

‚òùWhereas you will remain to be questioned about every minor and major deed 

üíêüíê There will be 3 types of grievers over you: üëà 

1- The people who knew you only at face value will say 'poor man'‚Äº

2- Your fiends will grieve for hours or days but then return to laughter‚Äº

3- The deep grief at your household will last for a week, two weeks, a month, 2-months or even a year üìÜ?

‚òùAnd thereafter they will add you to their memoirs ‚Äº

‚≠ï And so.. ‚≠ï

üëà Your story amidst the people ended 

And your story with the reality begins... ‚òùüëà 

And that is the life after death  üò¢
Indeed, these things left you üëà  
1- Beauty
2- Wealth 
3- Health 
4- Children
5- The mansions and places 
6- The spouse..

üëà And your real life has started  üëâ 

And the question here is‚ùì

What have you prepared for your grave and hereafter‚ùì

This reality needs to be thought over‚ùì

Take care of..‚òù
1- The obligations (e.g. prayer..)
2- Voluntary good deeds
3- Secret charity
4- Righteous deeds 
5- Night prayer 

‚úÖ Perhaps you will be saved ‚úÖ 

And don't forget to pass this message on to many... ‚≠ï 

üëà (Ÿàÿ∞ŸÉŸëÿ± ŸÅÿ•ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ∞ŸÉÿ±Ÿâ ÿ™ŸÜŸÅÿπŸè ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ§ŸÖŸÜŸäŸÜ) üëâ

If a person is happy living in Pakistan then it may mot be for him. 

It all depends on choices that everyone has.

I mean Benazir did it....to bail her out from Mr. Junejo's clutches. She called Indians to come on the border, engage Army so that she could take care of June jo. .....
Then, Zardari through Hussain Haqqani tried to implicate it's own Army and the ISI.....it's something that happened in the previous regime.
And now wenever there is a threat to the throne.....someone lends a hand or  assistance  to NS

10/8/16, 1:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Chinese from grade 4
10/8/16, 1:58 AM - Faraz Kashif: Hmmm
10/8/16, 1:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Arabic is only taught in  "Scriptures" class
10/8/16, 1:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: not up to the mark
10/8/16, 1:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: so gotta do it on ur own
10/8/16, 2:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Italian from grade 1
10/8/16, 2:00 AM - Faraz Kashif: Than no doubt about what you said earlier
Makes you wanna think as if AUS is part of Asia and not a continent on its own
üòäüòä
10/8/16, 2:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Australia is big on children being multilingual
10/8/16, 2:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Australia is part of Asia

10/8/16, 2:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: India is a big trading partner
10/8/16, 2:06 AM - Faraz Kashif: Yes to INAM and NAVEED

Indian public is, and will never be ready for this TUSSLE 
cause it will send them back decades and kill their future planning
10/8/16, 2:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: in the end all will depend on whats being planned in the background
10/8/16, 2:08 AM - Faraz Kashif: India is doing great in their manufacturing and stock market
10/8/16, 2:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Turmoil on the scale we haven't seen in 70 years is upon us

10/8/16, 2:09 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: if they want to burnbthe world, unfortunately not a better time than ours today
10/8/16, 2:17 AM - Faraz Kashif: No wander in such times
Even the simplest of classic humour takes center stage 

I love it
10/8/16, 2:23 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: https://youtu.be/c_20cT2ErF4
10/8/16, 2:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faraz National Geographic captured our neighbourhood

10/8/16, 2:36 AM - Faraz Kashif: Its has some of the amazing interior and remote coastal areas
10/8/16, 2:37 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: The thing thats very striking is the mashup of Welsh landscape with Tropical fauna flora
10/8/16, 2:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Sydney is European as well as Tropical
10/8/16, 2:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Brisbane is Tropical
10/8/16, 2:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Melbourne is European
10/8/16, 2:41 AM - Faraz Kashif: Tropical rainforest looks awesome there
10/8/16, 2:42 AM - Faraz Kashif: Have you been to Melbourne
10/8/16, 2:42 AM - Faraz Kashif: ??
10/8/16, 2:46 AM - Faraz Kashif: When you say European 
You mean depressing, smelly suburbs üòÇüòÇ

10/8/16, 2:52 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: lol
10/8/16, 2:52 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: European as in general landscape
10/8/16, 2:53 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Melbourne is right up there with Vancouver as one of the most beautiful cities in the World
10/8/16, 2:59 AM - Faraz Kashif: AUS offers a beautiful variety
Only downside = over a huge landscape 
Lot of land to cover to recognise its true beauty
10/8/16, 2:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yeah we have it all but requires too much travel
10/8/16, 3:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: one of the biggest deserts in the world is here as well
10/8/16, 3:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: thats why no place like Pakistan

10/8/16, 3:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: kms
10/8/16, 3:02 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: except Tropical Pakistan has almost everything
10/8/16, 3:02 AM - Faraz Kashif: Very true 
Pakistan over short lanscape you can experience similar
10/8/16, 3:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: An average Australian household is an explorer
10/8/16, 3:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: while poverty and worries keep Pakistanis locked out of specatacular sceneries
10/8/16, 3:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ISB in summertime feels tropical though
10/8/16, 3:07 AM - Faraz Kashif: The large lanscape has raised  Outdoors mentality in Australians and it comes natural to them

Smaller lanscapes calls for folks to remain indoors 
Just look at out childhood 
Almost 2 decades and what did we do ....
From one Corner to the other Corner of Corniche than back home again
10/8/16, 3:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: rain and all
10/8/16, 3:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÄ
10/8/16, 3:09 AM - Faraz Kashif: üòä
10/8/16, 3:15 AM - Faraz Kashif: And to think late 1700's to mid 1800's they thought convicts were the best of the planets population suited to enjoy the views of the outback  

Either that was a massive long term planning or simply nature taking its course 
üòÇüòÇ
10/8/16, 3:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: haha

fasting on 9th & 10th Muharram...
 
Monday 9th & Tuesday  10th Oct in UAE

Tuesday 10th Oct & Wednesday 11 Oct in Pakistan
The Virtues of Fasting 'Ashura'

Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said:

"I never saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) so keen to fast any day and give it priority over any other than this day, the day of 'Ashura', and this month, meaning Ramadhan."Reported by Al-Bukhari, 1867
 
2, Sawm Muharram]

Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "'Ashura' is the tenth day of Muharram. This is the opinion of Sa'id ibn al-Musayyib and al-Hasan. It was what was reported by Ibn 'Abbas, who said: 'The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to fast'Ashura', the tenth day of Muharram.' [Reported by at-Tirmidhi, who said, a sahih hasan hadith] It was reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: 'The ninth,' and reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast the ninth. [Reported by Muslim] 'Ata' reported that he said, 'Fast the ninth and the tenth, and do not be like the Jews.' If this is understood, we can say on this basis that it is mustahabb (encouraged) to fast on the ninth and the tenth, for that reason.

A Pakistani goes to Walmart in the U.S. 

He finds cat food at special prices. 

He picks a dozen cans of cat food & goes to check out.

The Manager gets suspicious. He thinks that this guy might not have a cat & will probably feed cat food to his kids. He asks the pakistani to show him his cat before he could let him have cat food.

He goes home & returns with a cat & gets to buy the cat food.

Next week the Pakistani finds dog food at special prices. 

He picks a dozen cans of dog food & goes to check out‚Ä¶

The Manager again gets suspicious. He thinks that this guy may have a cat but he cannot have a dog & he will probably feed dog food to his kids. 

He asks the him to bring & show him the dog before he can let him have dog food.

The Pakistani goes home & returns with a dog. 

He gets to buy the dog food.

The following week,  he  comes to Walmart with a bag. He asks the Manager to put his hand in the bag. The Manager puts his hand in the bag, feels some thing slimy & immediately pulls it out‚Ä¶!!!

He shouts at the Pakistani , ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶!!! 

This is shit, You Idiot‚Ä¶!!!???‚Äù

The Pakistani calmly replies, ‚ÄúYes, now may I buy some toilet paper please‚Ä¶???‚Äù

1. A talk was delivered by Major General Dr Azhar Mahmood Kayani, a renowned cardiologist, on *Prevention of Heart Diseases*, at NUST . The guest speaker introduced to the audience a very handy kit which may protect a person from dying of sudden heart attack. It has following items :-
 a. Tab Disprin  ‚Äì 4
 b. Tab Angisid  ‚Äì 4
 c. Deponit NT5 skin patch  ‚Äì 1
2. The worthy professor elaborated that if one feels sudden tightness and pain in centre of chest, radiating to left arm or both sides of neck, accompanied by sweating and uneasiness, one is likely to be in a state of heart attack. Following measures must be taken immediately :-
 a. Keeping one Angisid tablet under the tongue.
 b. Chewing one Disprin tablet.
 c. Pealing of and sticking the Deponit NT5 skin patch on left side of chest.
3.  The items of this kit cost about Rs 50-55, without any specific expert handling but can definitely save a person from dying immediately of a heart attack.
4.  It is advised that every individual, above 40 years of age, must prepare a kit of his / her own and should always carry inside one‚Äôs pocket (hand-bag ‚Äì in case of ladies).
5. Please disseminate the contents of the message to all about whom you care.

10/11/16, 9:20 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Aoa brothers!!!!
Please spare just two minutes to defend the rights of our Kashmiri brothers and sisters who are being butchered and raped as the world turns a blind eye. The Indian Army's vile atrocities must be halted, and the UN Secretary, General Ban Ki Moon, must understand that for evil to prevail all that is required is that good men like him do nothing:-  http://chn.ge/2dNObwS
10/11/16, 9:44 PM - Mashood Yunus: Excellently said naveed.  I will also spread the message to all my minnesota based mailing lists.
10/11/16, 9:45 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Naveed, thanks for forwarding the petition, this is the least we can do to support thus cause
10/11/16, 9:45 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: üëç
10/11/16, 9:46 PM - Inamullah Qamar: Well we should hope that Mrs Amir Amin is not reading these msgs.....üòäüòäüòä
10/11/16, 9:46 PM - Mashood Yunus: Some times we are also afraid of offending our indian muslim brothers and sisters but easy way to explain them is that obviously there are things happening in kashmir, this is why the agenda is out there. It is not about supporting pakistan, it is about standing up for justice for Kashmir just like we need to do for palestine, burma or syria
10/11/16, 9:47 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Inam you took works out of my mouth or rather from my keyboard üòÄ
10/11/16, 9:48 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Admin guard this group well

10/11/16, 9:57 PM - Ziad Asghar: Very important for Pakistan and the signing was delayed due to the stupid dharna.
10/11/16, 10:01 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Pakistan's priority.
10/11/16, 10:03 PM - Mashood Yunus: What do you mean signing of the petition was delayed due to the dharna by 
Pti?
10/11/16, 10:03 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Yes Mashhood
10/11/16, 10:03 PM - Mashood Yunus: What = ziad, stupid autocorrect
10/11/16, 10:04 PM - Ziad Asghar: Signing of CPEC was delayed due to dharna.

10/11/16, 10:06 PM - Mashood Yunus: I thought you were talking about Navid petition
10/11/16, 10:09 PM - Mashood Yunus: Got it. China is rude to Chinese muslims too so do not have much thoughts for them. Time will tell
10/11/16, 10:09 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Muslims are the rudest to Muslims
10/11/16, 10:10 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: üëçüëç
10/11/16, 10:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: the rest of the world capitalises on that
10/11/16, 10:11 PM - Ziad Asghar: CPEC is a huge opportunity for pak so I hope we don't play politics with it..
10/11/16, 10:11 PM - Mashood Yunus: Correct but doesnt absolve rest of the world though
10/11/16, 10:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üëç
10/11/16, 10:12 PM - Mashood Yunus: If they capitalize on it, they will have consequences too
10/11/16, 10:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we are in no position to deliver consequences
10/11/16, 10:13 PM - Mashood Yunus: When we dont and not even stand up against it, it fuels others among us to take matters in their hands
10/11/16, 10:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: we need to get our house in order
10/11/16, 10:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: not if our house is in order

10/11/16, 10:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Paththar tu maarangay log
10/11/16, 10:14 PM - Mashood Yunus: But until that doesnt happen and others.capitalize it, we should make it clear to others what they are doing ia not correct
10/11/16, 10:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: ghar sheeshay ka kab talak
10/11/16, 10:14 PM - Faisal Farooqi: So changing CPEC route multiple times to suit current govt was not politics or that was also forced by dharna?
10/11/16, 10:15 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: they have their interests
10/11/16, 10:15 PM - Ziad Asghar: It wasn't changed, mostly a drama from IK.
10/11/16, 10:15 PM - Faisal Farooqi: This is the unfortunate truth
10/11/16, 10:15 PM - Mashood Yunus: That is why, time will tell :)  their interests or our stand
10/11/16, 10:15 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faisal that is NS/Saudi/Dibai politics

10/11/16, 10:41 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: In the previous year I have studied CPEC and Gwadar extensively. But from a strategic perspective and its linkages to world geo-economics and Pakistan's national interests. 
Unfortunately, have no interest in business ventures so can't really offer a comment on that.
10/11/16, 10:41 PM - Mashood Yunus: Checking
10/11/16, 10:42 PM - Mashood Yunus: But nveed, u agree that cPEC is good foe pakistan in general? From your extensive study ...
10/11/16, 10:43 PM - Mashood Yunus: Just a novice questioj, to benefit from your hard work
10/11/16, 10:45 PM - Waseem Choudry: Alhumdulillah
10/11/16, 10:46 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: Does anyone remember the day IK and Pakistan Cricket team came to our school...all of us were lined up in the main ground...  Sir Chaudhary got really excited... üòÇ

10/11/16, 10:50 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Bhai where we r today, it seems essential for a few simple reasons:-
1. It enables and energises Pak economy which is in doldrums. 
2. It provides the state with a tool to eradicate socio-economic disparities. 
3. It raises China's SECURITY stakes in Pakistan by allowing it to circumvent the MALACCA DILEMMA and thus avoid the American noose. 
4. It will ensure Chinese presence in Indian Ocean Region thus denying the Police Man role India intends to assume in our South. 
5. This project has the potential to suck in Russia, Cen Asian Republics and Iran. 
And I can write for hours. 
We need it for honourable survival is the bottom line.
10/11/16, 10:51 PM - Mashood Yunus: Excellent this all makes sense thanks so so much
10/11/16, 10:51 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Welcome bro
10/11/16, 10:52 PM - Mashood Yunus: Naveed. For educating me

But seriously, even he was embarrassed üòÖ
10/11/16, 10:55 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: haha
10/11/16, 10:55 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: all credit to Sir Chaudhry
10/11/16, 10:57 PM - Ziad Asghar: I don't remember that so must have moved to islamia by that time.
10/11/16, 10:58 PM - Faisal Farooqi: This is what I was saying earlier, a very key project for Pakistan and we must do whatever we can to make it successful. Could be as simple as just visiting the city and local area. I personally also do not have any business interests but if there are opportunities to contribute towards making it successful I want to know.
10/11/16, 11:00 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I don't recall it either.... I do remember visiting Sharjah ground for a few matches
10/11/16, 11:01 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Ahmer and I watched the Australasia cup match in 90 when Wasim got a hat-trick to end the match
10/11/16, 11:03 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faisal Ziad it was either 86 or 87
10/11/16, 11:03 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: must have been some shj series
10/11/16, 11:04 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: I visited Gawadar last year. As of now, development work in in progress on the port and inland routes plus energy projects. 
Unfortunately there are so many political gimmicks and distractors at work.  
Army is proving security but beyond that it's difficult to push the politicians. 
Let's hope the best.
10/11/16, 11:06 PM - Ziad Asghar: Good that army does the security and doesn't do more.  :)
10/11/16, 11:07 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: I do remember. The entire school was lined up in the front ground. The team came in and stood infront. And then was that funny IMRAN HAAN ZINDABAD"
MANAYGER CIRKAT TEAM ZINDABAD" by Ch Saab.
10/11/16, 11:08 PM - Ziad Asghar: BTW, sir jawed was intersting, came on as PT guy and became almost the administrator.
10/11/16, 11:09 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: A bit of nudging to keep Ganjas and Bhutos on track üòúüòúüòúüòú

10/11/16, 11:09 PM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: But his shouting was ugly and uncalled for in an educational institution.
10/11/16, 11:10 PM - Ziad Asghar: Agree, he created a position for himself.
10/11/16, 11:10 PM - Ziad Asghar: But wasn't very refined

10/12/16, 2:41 AM - Faraz Kashif: My father came home from office, and started crying last night while he was alone in the room.
I inquired and he said he shouldnt have seen the raw footage that some one in his office showed him.
He said he saw a muslim kashmiri with a rod shoved down his throat. That rod had passed thru his bottom side clear thru the body
He was bleeding all over and the 3 of the Indian Army soldiers were jumping and kicking him as if he was a pillow
All the meanwhile his wife and children were saying "Allah kay wastay, Mohammad kay wastay issay chorr do"
Than they go on to butcher him in 5 pieces with a machete.

He was trembling with terror and said he has never seen anything like that before in his life and cant help the images flashing before his eyes. I stayed by his bed side to help him sleep. 

May ALLAH help the innocent men women and children of Kashmir 
*Guys I URGE everyone here to please take 3 minutes to sign this Petition* and pass it on to others we know it can definitely make an impact Inshallah

10/12/16, 6:45 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: G4 Baby! Go for it. Best bang for the buck
10/12/16, 6:46 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Haven't bought it yet
10/12/16, 6:47 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Peace will remain elusive.
10/12/16, 6:47 AM - Nassar Nizami: Naveed, I remember him well. He was ex-military and knew uncle
10/12/16, 6:48 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Heard n read about its boot-lag and freezing issues. Don't know how true is that!!!
10/12/16, 6:49 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: my nephew had the G3 and has G4 now. Very happy
10/12/16, 6:49 AM - Nassar Nizami: Oh yes.. hitler!

10/12/16, 6:50 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Sadr saheb sey haath milaya hai mein nay *another way of saying you worthless piece of sh#t*
10/12/16, 6:52 AM - Imran Farhat: Wao we have a new saying , so the new generation will learn this along many othersüò¨
10/12/16, 6:52 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Nasir. Anyone of our classmates living in or around Ohio. 
Will InshaAllah be coming there for about 3 weeks early next year.
10/12/16, 6:52 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hitler used to say this to ppl who trolled him
10/12/16, 6:54 AM - Mashood Yunus: naveed, that is right in between where I live and where nasir lives, so probably 12 hours drive for both of us.  faisal might be closer to you though, coming from chicago ...
10/12/16, 6:55 AM - Imran Farhat: Naveed on the lighter side .
You miss spelled Ohio that's OHO and all of us luckily are living with OHO and around OHO.üòÇ
10/12/16, 6:55 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: üòõüòõüòõüòõ

10/12/16, 6:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: Assalam-o-Alaikum all of you boring souls, only 120 messages in past 7 hours .... hunh
10/12/16, 6:56 AM - Nassar Nizami: Murtaza is in Ohio. Depending on where you are, Faisal maybe driving distance
10/12/16, 6:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: O Hi O
10/12/16, 6:57 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: I think it would Dayton
10/12/16, 6:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hameed bhai oho ho ho ho ho
10/12/16, 6:58 AM - Imran Farhat: üòÇüòÇüò±üò±üò±üòÇüòÇ
10/12/16, 6:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Sona Chandi fans will remember
10/12/16, 7:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faiz Saheb wrote brilliantly addressing this very issue
10/12/16, 7:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 7:27 AM - Mashood Yunus: although, i have always enjoyed loved reading urdu and esp. poetry but please tell me what is he trying to convey here?
10/12/16, 7:27 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÄ
10/12/16, 7:29 AM - Mashood Yunus: except Iqbal, it doesn't seem anyone else seems to write to uplift spirits.  it seems most are using awesome words but delivering discouraging and pathetic messages to people.
10/12/16, 7:29 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: mashhood obviously you never understood Faiz then
10/12/16, 7:30 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: not every poem is for inspiration
10/12/16, 7:30 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Poetry is of different kinds
10/12/16, 7:30 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the poem above by Faiz is stating hard cold facts
10/12/16, 7:30 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: bitter truth
10/12/16, 7:31 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: for ppl who bury their ostrich heads in the ground
10/12/16, 7:32 AM - Mashood Yunus: well good, I am glad i stopped reading such poetry long ago, alhamdulillah
10/12/16, 7:32 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Reaching for the morsl high ground once again brother
10/12/16, 7:32 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ?
10/12/16, 7:32 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: moral
10/12/16, 7:33 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: comparison is the origin of fear
10/12/16, 7:33 AM - Mashood Yunus: we need action and work to do and Allah has blessed us with much.  This means I do not need to understand his message although I had heard this poem several times long ago
10/12/16, 7:33 AM - Mashood Yunus: no matter how beautiful of the words he tried to use
10/12/16, 7:34 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: you started on a negative preconceived notion
10/12/16, 7:34 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: you weren't going far anyway
10/12/16, 7:34 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: not befitting a Muslim
10/12/16, 7:36 AM - Mashood Yunus: if you read that message in isolation, there is nothing useful about it :) and with given amount of time, we do not need to invest in those
10/12/16, 7:37 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: The poem above talks about Khudi and directly links with the Quranic verse about God only helping those who help themselves
10/12/16, 7:37 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: read the poem again
10/12/16, 7:37 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: impulsivity is Satanic
10/12/16, 7:37 AM - Mashood Yunus: in this context, it still doesn't convey that message to me
10/12/16, 7:38 AM - Mashood Yunus: so may be I am just not the kind, who can use this kind of written work for any inspiration
10/12/16, 7:38 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: maybe
10/12/16, 7:38 AM - Mashood Yunus: alhamdulillah for that
10/12/16, 7:39 AM - Mashood Yunus: long ago, i quit certain kind of poetry.  Iqbal still works for me, for most part, alhamdulillah for what I can understand
10/12/16, 7:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: but to the others who understand his poetry such is not the case
10/12/16, 7:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: dont go defensive
10/12/16, 7:39 AM - Mashood Yunus: defensive?
10/12/16, 7:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Alhamdulillah is a word abused by Muslims to reach for higher moral ground
10/12/16, 7:40 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: u are better than that
10/12/16, 7:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: alhamdulillah again :)
10/12/16, 7:40 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Poetry is surely not for u :)
10/12/16, 7:41 AM - Mashood Yunus: except Iqbaal's :)
10/12/16, 7:41 AM - Mashood Yunus: but thanks, I got what I was looking for, the main point of that message and how does it relate to "taking the first step"
10/12/16, 7:42 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Anytime :)
10/12/16, 7:42 AM - Imran Farhat: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 7:43 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÄ
10/12/16, 7:44 AM - Imran Farhat: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 7:44 AM - Mashood Yunus: so now, this one is about how we could mend the relations if we do not jump the gun?  and wait for a while ...
10/12/16, 7:44 AM - Mashood Yunus: and last one is the awesome quality of urdu
10/12/16, 7:44 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yep jumping too quickly with Alhamdulillah ; (
10/12/16, 7:45 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Urdu as we've known it
10/12/16, 7:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: no aqeel, that is also for certain kind of only, who think only in that arena
10/12/16, 7:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: I will leave at that
10/12/16, 7:45 AM - Imran Farhat: Very intelligently interpreted ü§î
10/12/16, 7:46 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÄ
10/12/16, 7:46 AM - Mashood Yunus: Urdu accepts words and just owns them so much, being a derived language, I think that is one of the best quality but I am sure the original urdu lovers will twist after reading this last poem
10/12/16, 7:47 AM - Mashood Yunus: but mean while, somewhere it is starting to sound like a "burger" language :(
10/12/16, 7:50 AM - Imran Farhat: Yes that's very true we really some how are missing our roots ,
When I am speaking to my kids and I say patloon , feetay , moozay, etc . And they behave like I am using some sort of out of the planet language they make me confuse also ü§î
10/12/16, 7:52 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Well that's the problem of living in UAE. They lose Urdu and they wont integrate with Arabs because our brothers are just so welcoming
10/12/16, 7:53 AM - Mashood Yunus: well, living in USA, our kids are also learning same things Br Imran and Aqeel, there are no arabs here
10/12/16, 7:53 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: At times it becomes difficult to separate evolution from undesired change.
10/12/16, 7:53 AM - Shakil Ahmed: üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
10/12/16, 7:53 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood the kids have far  more sense of belonging in the West
10/12/16, 7:53 AM - Mashood Yunus: yet they speak urdu?
10/12/16, 7:54 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: no but look at my above statement
10/12/16, 7:54 AM - Mashood Yunus: so it means that what we do at home impacts them regardless of where they live
10/12/16, 7:54 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: they can integrate better
10/12/16, 7:54 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Urdu is gone from their lives
10/12/16, 7:55 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: I am focusing on my kids learning arabic and chinese
10/12/16, 7:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: while our kids might not understand the usual words (like imran pointed to), it will remain in their minds insha-Allah
10/12/16, 7:55 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Arabic for Deen
10/12/16, 7:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: any language is good to have and learn
10/12/16, 7:55 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Chinese for Duniya
10/12/16, 7:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: one of the important prinicples
10/12/16, 7:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: we do not need to drop any language, esp mother tongue but focus on other languages need to have dawah as a priority too - such as the two you mentioned aqeel
10/12/16, 7:56 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: English is their mother tongue now
10/12/16, 7:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: they think and dream in it
10/12/16, 7:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and no matter how much we try its not going to change
10/12/16, 7:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: but that's ok
10/12/16, 7:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: correct, nothing wrong with that
10/12/16, 7:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: but other languages will remain with them too, so when need to use them, they do not have to start with zero
10/12/16, 7:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: a child needs a solid identity and sense of belonging
10/12/16, 7:59 AM - Mashood Yunus: that is Islam for them ... and diversity just makes it better
10/12/16, 7:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: that idenity need not be generations old
10/12/16, 7:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: disagree
10/12/16, 7:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Islam is not an identity
10/12/16, 7:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: its our ideology
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Identity is our tribe and culture and environment
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: i know we did disagree, doo disagree, will disagree
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: Our identity living in west is Islam and nothing else
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah created us into tribes and nations
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: no wrong
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: so we are identified to each other
10/12/16, 8:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: correct but our glue is Islam
10/12/16, 8:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: these are words of the Quran
10/12/16, 8:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Islam is ideology
10/12/16, 8:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: NOT identity
10/12/16, 8:01 AM - Mashood Yunus: and ... that ideology is our identity
10/12/16, 8:02 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: look up the meanings of the two words
10/12/16, 8:02 AM - Mashood Yunus: do not need to,
10/12/16, 8:02 AM - Mashood Yunus: we have our own meaning given our realities
10/12/16, 8:02 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Wr are not Bani Isrsel
10/12/16, 8:02 AM - Mashood Yunus: why let others define it when we are in new situations and circumstances
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: this is the thinking of Bani Israel
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: not really
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: but thanks for putting your mind set out there
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Islam is an ideology of entire mankind
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ppl with various identities
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: pls do not confuse the two
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the verse in thr Quran is clear
10/12/16, 8:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: you are playing with words unnecessarily
10/12/16, 8:04 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... yes, that was just to highlught that... tribes and nations are only to 'know' one another...  'ŸÑÿ™ÿπÿßÿ±ŸÅŸà'€î€î€î   .. one tribe is not better than other tribe... lineage is another thing
10/12/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Li Ta arafu
10/12/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: look up the meaning
10/12/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: taaruf is thru identity
10/12/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: who u r
10/12/16, 8:04 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Islam transcends tribes and nations...
10/12/16, 8:05 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and the words tribes and nations set thr background for tjis taaruf
10/12/16, 8:05 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: As a belief system yes but its not an identity
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mashood Yunus: and our ta'aruf in the west is Islam ... and I am a Muslim, who has other terms associated with him ... and we are proud of them alhamdulillah but Islam is our identity for rest of the life
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Identity is thru tribes and nationd
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: as used inQuran
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mashood Yunus: secondarily, Aqeel
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Imran Farhat: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: tell that to a white Caucasian muslim
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mashood Yunus: primarily, no
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mashood Yunus: I do and find write answers
10/12/16, 8:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Brother Suhaib webb for example
10/12/16, 8:07 AM - Mashood Yunus: Brother Yusha Evans for example :)
10/12/16, 8:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üëç
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes.. Suhaib has rightly called for American Muslims to identify themselves as Anerican
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: completely separate from Middle east
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: which i fullu agree with
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: fully
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mashood Yunus: while we surely focus on having Islam as our first introduction
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mashood Yunus: you may, you have the right to.
10/12/16, 8:08 AM - Mashood Yunus: and be able to defend it on day of judgement, when Allah asks
10/12/16, 8:09 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes... we need to remember our roots... you will see here in the US , people still refer to themselves as german, Italian, spanish, polish, greek, Russian, french, dutch... with great pride even after decades
10/12/16, 8:09 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah will address ppl You son of Fulan and Fulan
10/12/16, 8:09 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: nothing wrong with that
10/12/16, 8:10 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah wants us to bind together despite our different backgrounds
10/12/16, 8:10 AM - Mashood Yunus: we should be proud of our secondary identities but should never forget our primary identity
10/12/16, 8:10 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: that's what its sll about
10/12/16, 8:10 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes... we should do that as well...
10/12/16, 8:10 AM - Mashood Yunus: probably first statement, I am going to agree with Aqeel today
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Our identity as described in the Quran is Our Tribes and Nations
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... there is something... Where are you from... Who are you... what do you practice...
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Mashood Yunus: nope
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Mashood Yunus: definitely shakil, we should always be proud of that but should never forget, who we are "first"
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Islam is Our Deen
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Ma Deenuk
10/12/16, 8:11 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: is the question we will be asked

10/12/16, 8:12 AM - Shakil Ahmed: onlyy
10/12/16, 8:12 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood u need to revisit this
10/12/16, 8:12 AM - Imran Farhat: Bhai log yeah baat bohot dur talak jayegi is liye is ko yahin khatam kardain.
10/12/16, 8:13 AM - Mashood Yunus: of course aqeel, comes from confidence
10/12/16, 8:13 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: we have a fb page also rightly worded
10/12/16, 8:13 AM - Mashood Yunus: Imran ... or time for "1991 religious discussion: group
10/12/16, 8:13 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Pakistan us my identity and Islam is my ideology

10/12/16, 8:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: Islam is our first identity and that is how we are recognized

10/12/16, 8:15 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Suhaib Webb.  He will kill u
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yusha will not but ... will make dua for you to have right understanding
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... Pakistani American Muslim
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: no shakil
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: anothee one upmanship?  :)
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood u need to revisit this
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: I do not aqeel. thanks.  there are certain boundaries, Allah clarified for me long ago
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Shakil Ahmed: When you are among other Muslims.... what do you say?
10/12/16, 8:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: and alhamdulillah for that
10/12/16, 8:17 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: good question
10/12/16, 8:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: Shakil - A Muslim pakistani raised in UAE
10/12/16, 8:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: very easy and to the point, alhamdulillah

10/12/16, 8:18 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... I am not sure if that can be categorized in any of tgr census survey
10/12/16, 8:18 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 8:18 AM - Mashood Yunus: shakil, i promised I will stop :) otherwise it is a fairly simple answer
10/12/16, 8:19 AM - Mashood Yunus: when i take teenagers to "Muslim identity" lectures,
10/12/16, 8:19 AM - Shakil Ahmed: ok.. what is that?
10/12/16, 8:19 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Shakil Taaruf is mentioned together with tribes abd bations
10/12/16, 8:19 AM - Mashood Yunus: it calls for their teacher to know what he / she is doing :)
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... let me ask you... how do you identify a Muslim in a group without asking them?
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: http://www.everyayah.com/data/images_png/49_13.png
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Shakil check the link
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Taaruf us thru nations and tribed
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: simple
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Mashood Yunus: depends on the need, shakil
10/12/16, 8:20 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: us = is
10/12/16, 8:21 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... see it depends...
10/12/16, 8:21 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah created us in tribes and nations so that we nay know each other
10/12/16, 8:21 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Identity
10/12/16, 8:21 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: may
10/12/16, 8:22 AM - Mashood Yunus: the need doesn't take away my identity, shakil ...
10/12/16, 8:22 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... there are different identities..
10/12/16, 8:22 AM - Shakil Ahmed: identity of race, nationality, religion
10/12/16, 8:23 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the identity as described in the Quran is based on nations and tribes
10/12/16, 8:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the verse is clear
10/12/16, 8:24 AM - Mashood Yunus: ok can shakil and aqeel send a picture of the weather from outside their windows.  I think aqeel, you have night time there, correct?
10/12/16, 8:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: religion (deen) is not mentioned as a criteria
10/12/16, 8:24 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... yes... that's true.....
10/12/16, 8:25 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Deen is mentioned in the following words in the form of Taqwa
10/12/16, 8:25 AM - Shakil Ahmed: when you introduce yourself to each other..
10/12/16, 8:25 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... yes...
10/12/16, 8:25 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: to clearly tell us that you can ve anyone based on identity but u will only be close to Allah if you have taqws
10/12/16, 8:25 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: taqwa
10/12/16, 8:26 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: so taqwa will trump lineage/identity in the eyes of Allah but u cannot wear taqwa on ur sleeves going around the world
10/12/16, 8:27 AM - Shakil Ahmed: so as I said... the first verse is to stress that... your tribe and race shouldn't be basis of status, but taqwa
10/12/16, 8:27 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: you will still be identified as tribe/bation
10/12/16, 8:27 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: nation
10/12/16, 8:27 AM - Mashood Yunus: awesome discussion, should we keep going in a separate group "1991 religious discussion"
10/12/16, 8:27 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: I will retire
10/12/16, 8:27 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: i rest my argument
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: time for skeepw
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... that's the next step.. when you are walking and talking Muslim
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: it is only 11 PM with you, you can retire
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: 1239am gere
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: no you cannot
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Imran Farhat: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: retire
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: 1230am here
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: entertain us with some other fun things
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: we moved one hour ahead last week
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Mashood Yunus: like a nice lateefah
10/12/16, 8:28 AM - Shakil Ahmed: we are all talking.about same thing from different perspectives
10/12/16, 8:29 AM - Mashood Yunus: oho, midnight, that is just start of the fun for your aqeel
10/12/16, 8:29 AM - Mashood Yunus: yes .. shakil ... break will help and imran is about to kill us
10/12/16, 8:29 AM - Shakil Ahmed: you aren't completely defined only by tribe or religion
10/12/16, 8:29 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Bhayio. Excellent discussion. Conceptually Aqeel is right in my view (every one has the right to one). Have a sound sleep.
10/12/16, 8:29 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÄ
10/12/16, 8:30 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Shab Bakhair
10/12/16, 8:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: thanks for input Naveed.
10/12/16, 8:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: imran, that depends on setting
10/12/16, 8:30 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Thanks bro
10/12/16, 8:30 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... count the stars
10/12/16, 8:31 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel and Mashhood.....
10/12/16, 8:31 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòá
10/12/16, 8:31 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes, shakil
10/12/16, 8:31 AM - Shakil Ahmed: a+b+c = b+a+c = c+a+b
10/12/16, 8:31 AM - Shakil Ahmed: hope u get iy
10/12/16, 8:31 AM - Shakil Ahmed: it
10/12/16, 8:34 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: This is termed as over simplification üòèüòèüòè
10/12/16, 8:35 AM - Mashood Yunus: I do and that is why, once a+b+c is decided (as a being Islam, b being pakistani and c being american), i will stick to it generally and not try b+a+c or c+a+b
10/12/16, 8:37 AM - Shakil Ahmed: agreed.... starting from abstract concepts helps in understanding different perspectives
10/12/16, 8:37 AM - Imran Farhat: What about c+b+a and b+c+a and a+c+b ü§îüòÇüòÇüòÇ
10/12/16, 8:38 AM - Shakil Ahmed: OK.... that's fair and will work if you first agree that your identity is not just a or just b or just c... It's the collection of all those attributes...
10/12/16, 8:39 AM - Mashood Yunus: all other 5 combinations only lead to trouble
10/12/16, 8:39 AM - Shakil Ahmed: what I am trying to say is that.... you can't be just Muslims, or Just Pakistani, ir Just American
10/12/16, 8:39 AM - Mashood Yunus: with a being the "a", it will be all fine.  every things else "b" and "c" will remain important but secondary, proud but secondary, needed but secondary
10/12/16, 8:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: we are products of our environments :)
10/12/16, 8:41 AM - Mashood Yunus: holding on to what you believe is most important at all times.  sometimes,  you get killed for that and sometimes you are apperciated
10/12/16, 8:41 AM - Shakil Ahmed: OK... another important concept is that all those are mutually exclusive... meaning you can be a Muslim, not Pakistani, not Living in US...
10/12/16, 8:42 AM - Shakil Ahmed: also... one can be non Muslim Pakistani living in US
10/12/16, 8:42 AM - Mashood Yunus: a true good case, masha-Allah in terms of great unity
10/12/16, 8:42 AM - Shakil Ahmed: or A Muslim Pakistani living in Australia
10/12/16, 8:42 AM - Mashood Yunus: I am strictly talking about Muslims :)
10/12/16, 8:43 AM - Mashood Yunus: so a Muslim Pakistani Australian is enough
10/12/16, 8:43 AM - Shakil Ahmed: OK... now how do u identify You and Aqeel?
10/12/16, 8:43 AM - Imran Farhat: Shakil and Mashhood don't forget you are in the group so please respect others and answer my qustion as well üòã
10/12/16, 8:43 AM - Mashood Yunus: even he/she need to identify with that kind of detail
10/12/16, 8:44 AM - Mashood Yunus: imran, i agree .. i answered your question. it depends on setting
10/12/16, 8:44 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Sorry... yes those work too.... according to our Maths teacher
10/12/16, 8:44 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Sometimes agreeing to disagree is enough to move on üòá
10/12/16, 8:45 AM - Imran Farhat: No it only depends how you set it üò†
10/12/16, 8:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: Aqeel .. I identify myself as Muslim often, but at work " I am a software engineer", in presentations, "I am a Muslim from Pakistan"
10/12/16, 8:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: not aqeel, shakil :)
10/12/16, 8:45 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal... situation here is that we disagree to agree on something we agree on
10/12/16, 8:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: your names are so similar
10/12/16, 8:46 AM - Mashood Yunus: oho, faisal is up ....
10/12/16, 8:46 AM - Mashood Yunus: bhaago ...
10/12/16, 8:46 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal... naashta kesa tha
10/12/16, 8:46 AM - Faisal Farooqi: No nashta for me, fasting
10/12/16, 8:47 AM - Shakil Ahmed: MashaAllah... sahri ?
10/12/16, 8:47 AM - Mashood Yunus: for the special day, masha-Allah, dua for acceptance and may Allah remove all injustice
10/12/16, 8:47 AM - Imran Farhat: Ameen
10/12/16, 8:47 AM - Mashood Yunus: br imran, not ignoring you at all :)
10/12/16, 8:47 AM - Imran Farhat: I am sure
10/12/16, 8:48 AM - Mashood Yunus: and i agree with what you say,  it is how you set it.  one should not be confused about it.  self reflection should allow a person to know who they are and what is their introductin, rest is easy after that with confidence and being comfortable with themselves about who they are
10/12/16, 8:51 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Yes... exactly.. that's what you want yourself to be... of course being Muslim is the most important...
10/12/16, 8:51 AM - Mashood Yunus: yes
10/12/16, 8:52 AM - Mashood Yunus: there is a reason "identity crisis" is a huge issue.  when a person decides their identity, the actions of rest of their life are often decided by that.   When a Muslim decides their identity, it takes a whole other meaning, leading to what is virtue and what is sin
10/12/16, 8:53 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes... remeber that Muslims are not only Arabs
10/12/16, 8:54 AM - Mashood Yunus: I am not sure, why you keep saying that?
10/12/16, 8:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: I learnt my deen from many arabs but not the ones in UAE, but one of them was a coptic christian from Egypt, yet my quran teacher for 16 years is a pakistani woman who taught me arabic grammar and helped me to teach it to others.
10/12/16, 8:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: it didn't matter to me if they were pakistani or arab but they gave me the gem of my life and that is what I was after.  they gave me my deen and with that my true identity, alhamdulillah
10/12/16, 9:11 AM - Mashood Yunus: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 9:11 AM - Mashood Yunus: I have been trying to find my albums but so far, i have failed. here are few pictures i found scanned many years ago.
10/12/16, 9:12 AM - Mashood Yunus: i think this last pic is from our classroom because I remember that white board being in our class
10/12/16, 9:15 AM - Faisal Farooqi: This would be about 3.5 hrs from Murtaza, 5 hours from Chicago
10/12/16, 9:16 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Seems gr8. Let's c how it works out.
10/12/16, 9:19 AM - Faisal Farooqi: This looks like 2nd year classroom to me but not sure.
10/12/16, 9:20 AM - Mashood Yunus: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 9:20 AM - Mashood Yunus: faisal, i think it is
10/12/16, 9:22 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I have no recollection of this nukkar even though I recall the trip and going to the beach
10/12/16, 9:23 AM - Mashood Yunus: i think raheel or saif took that picture and now if I can find raaheel.  yes i think some of us walked away from beach towards the land and there was this nice wooden structure.  i think they have taken down this wooden structure now
10/12/16, 9:25 AM - Ziad Asghar: How about a reunion in that area around that time
10/12/16, 9:26 AM - Ziad Asghar: I think I got aqeel in that pic.. üòä
10/12/16, 9:26 AM - Faraz Kashif: NAVEED you around still
10/12/16, 9:27 AM - Faraz Kashif: Someone mentioned Hitler that used to be at the gate enforcing discipline all the time
Ex military ???
10/12/16, 9:28 AM - Faraz Kashif: Tell me if this is him ??
10/12/16, 9:28 AM - Faraz Kashif: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 9:28 AM - Faraz Kashif: <Media omitted>
10/12/16, 9:28 AM - Faraz Kashif: üòäüòä
10/12/16, 9:29 AM - Faraz Kashif: 8 months ago
He is still with the school
Was happy to see me and remembered all of us bad boys 
üòÅüòÅ
10/12/16, 9:29 AM - Mashood Yunus: masha-Allah :)
10/12/16, 9:36 AM - Faraz Kashif: His name is BASHIR LALA
He is mellowed out now
10/12/16, 9:39 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I have a feeling bad boys are easier to remember due to extra interaction üòá
10/12/16, 9:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: well hopefully in my next UAE trip, i might get a chance to visit school :)  with you, Br salah took me to school in last trip but we didn't have time to go inside
10/12/16, 9:41 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I am in... if Naveed has arrival/departure date early enough we can pull this off
10/12/16, 9:42 AM - Mashood Yunus: i agree, if we know early, i will prefer to fly in instead of driving 11 hours
10/12/16, 9:45 AM - Faraz Kashif: *Thieves in the Temple Tonight*
üòÅüòÅ
10/12/16, 9:46 AM - Faraz Kashif: MUST MUST MUST 
Take Pictures
10/12/16, 9:49 AM - Faraz Kashif: Watch Aqeel 
The Prince in him is about to
*Shake a Leg* üòäüòä
10/12/16, 9:51 AM - Mashood Yunus: haha, thieves in the temple have a shahzaada (prince) and is being disrespected by Ziad, the fazool.  we should find out what will be the punishment for Ziad, when aqeel wakes up
10/12/16, 9:54 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Yep it's him dear.
10/12/16, 9:54 AM - Faraz Kashif: üòäüòäüíêüíêüòòüòò
10/12/16, 9:55 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: I will try to get the dates ASAP.
10/12/16, 9:58 AM - Faraz Kashif: Naveed torture them if they dont take pics üòäüòä
It would be good to see you all together
10/12/16, 10:00 AM - Imran Farhat: Naveed what are you into these days ü§î  you will try to get DATES .
Bhai log bach kay rehna yeh bhai sahab aap logon ko pitwana chahtay hain is lye yeh aap kay liye DATES arrange kar rahay hain
10/12/16, 10:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: uf, imran farhat say nahee bach saktay ... DATES

10/12/16, 10:24 AM - Mashood Yunus: oho, are you warning us about something to come?
10/12/16, 10:25 AM - Mashood Yunus: you have written it in all CAPS, sounds like serious warning .... ü§íüò∞üò∞üò∞
10/12/16, 10:32 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: üíÉüèªüíÉüèªüíÉüèªüíÉüèªüíÉüèªüíÉüèªüíÉüèª
10/12/16, 10:59 AM - Mohammad Ali: Naveed... you are core to next reunion in US. MashaAllah- good
10/12/16, 11:02 AM - Mohammad Ali: @12247158032 , i think another Islamic group is needed.

brothers, be very careful with Islamic discussions, to summarize- all were on same page but in different way.
10/12/16, 11:03 AM - Mohammad Ali: a small mistake may lead to disaster
10/12/16, 11:04 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I am done making groups and moderating discussions
10/12/16, 11:05 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Bhai. Seems I am in the middle of a hurricane. US walon ki reunion na hui to meray lagnay ka pura chance ha üíâüíâüíâüíâ
10/12/16, 11:06 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Absolutely right. Should be avoided at all costs.
10/12/16, 11:06 AM - Mohammad Ali: nahin. you have a leadership quality & just lead, all will follow.
10/12/16, 11:06 AM - Faisal Farooqi: We all are adults here and should know the boundaries, similarly respect should be maintained for all members of the group
10/12/16, 11:07 AM - Imran Farhat: Respect üôä 
ASAP
10/12/16, 11:07 AM - Mohammad Ali: this is for Naveed on üíâ
10/12/16, 11:08 AM - Mohammad Ali: it does not mean others are not leaders, but you lead to DATES there. We all will followüòú
10/12/16, 11:08 AM - Mohammad Ali: everyone here is born leader
10/12/16, 11:08 AM - Shakil Ahmed: when is this ?
10/12/16, 11:09 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Every one has the right to have a view. And it needs to be respected. No one can claim perfection. This quality rests with the creator alone. 
Anyway u r point is supported.
10/12/16, 11:09 AM - Mohammad Ali: üëç
10/12/16, 11:10 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Hahahhahahahahahaha
10/12/16, 11:11 AM - Imran Farhat: I have no hesitation saying ASAP mujhe to dar lagta hay üòã
10/12/16, 11:12 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Dar nahin. Himat kar larkay üòõüòõüòõ
10/12/16, 11:13 AM - Faisal Farooqi: What Naveed said above is exactly the point, we all have different opinions based on our experiences. Others members may not necessarily agree with them but when faced with a conflict of opinion it is best to back off and discuss it one to one via a phone call or similar. Text does not convey emotions no matter how many emojis are attached and there is a good chance that someone takes it the wrong way. At least 3 such incidents have occurred on this group already.
10/12/16, 11:14 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Bhai. Meray Ohio main aik 3 weeks ka course ha. May be in Jan or Apr. So there were plans by .....
10/12/16, 11:15 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Naveed... that's excellent...
10/12/16, 11:15 AM - Shakil Ahmed: April will better....
10/12/16, 11:16 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Jan... usually snow
10/12/16, 11:16 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I agree Apr is a better time but may not be in Naveed's control
10/12/16, 11:17 AM - Imran Farhat: Exactly jub hi DATES miljainüòÇ
10/12/16, 11:17 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes... jab bhi
10/12/16, 11:17 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Unfortunately I am unable to follow. But incidents lead to unnecessary friction. And friction should be avoided amongst friends and brothers. So ..... Boys sit back and relax. That's the essence of life.
10/12/16, 11:17 AM - Shakil Ahmed: you mean.. KHAJOOR?
10/12/16, 11:18 AM - Imran Farhat: Don't act like polli
10/12/16, 11:18 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes..... relax
10/12/16, 11:20 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Shakeel, you won't let the group enjoy DATES, even in imagination üòâ
10/12/16, 11:20 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Bhai I will try to push it to Apr as advised. But can't be sure right away. Inshallah will let u know.
10/12/16, 11:21 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal.... why not.... as long it's. DATES..... not just a DATE... remember it's a group
10/12/16, 11:21 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Yes, lets put a temporary ban on folks who kill the joy üòÄ
10/12/16, 11:22 AM - Imran Farhat: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10/12/16, 11:22 AM - Shakil Ahmed: oye
10/12/16, 11:23 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal. .. for Jan... how is Kalahari in Sandusky OH?
10/12/16, 11:23 AM - Naveed Ahmed Awan: Shrarti bacho. ü§óü§óü§ó
10/12/16, 11:24 AM - Imran Farhat: ASAP
10/12/16, 11:24 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I have never been to Kalahari or any water resorts, will check with Murtaza.... I think he went once
10/12/16, 11:24 AM - Shakil Ahmed: it's indoor... good for winter
10/12/16, 11:24 AM - Imran Farhat: ASAP

10/12/16, 11:29 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Lake Placid NY.  Adirondacks region
10/12/16, 11:30 AM - Shakil Ahmed: beautiful fall
10/12/16, 11:31 AM - Mohammad Ali: i remember that crocodile movie named: Lake Placid (Part 1 & 2) üòá

10/12/16, 4:20 PM - Mashood Yunus: haha, very funny video ... of punishment
10/12/16, 4:21 PM - Mashood Yunus: i think it must still be happening at SKBZAPC, there is no law stopping it but frequency must have reduced, hopefully
10/12/16, 4:27 PM - Imran Farhat: Very recently my nephew was complaining about Sir Abdul RAZAQ for his free hand and this matter was taken to the higher authorities
10/12/16, 4:37 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: That's good to know. I hope the authorities clamp down on this abuse.
10/12/16, 4:40 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Imran you are talking about Islamia English School? I don't think situation is any different at Pakistani school from our times
10/12/16, 4:48 PM - Imran Farhat: I am not sure about Pakistani School but all the rest of the schools are fitted with the cameras and the education authorities are simply waiting for the complains.
10/12/16, 4:51 PM - Faisal Farooqi: On the other side if we did not have corporal punishment a lot of golden moments we all remember won't have happened
10/12/16, 4:55 PM - Imran Farhat: Exactly I was wondering the punishment those days were entirely different then now .
For example I punish my kid by saying you will not play game for a week.

Earlier it was there and then a slap , a stick or a duster .

So these days the punishment is far harder then before.
10/12/16, 4:56 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Even during our school days it was apparent that punishment does not translate into better understanding or grades. Among the male teachers take the example of Sir Raza,  I do not remember him ever punishing anyone but he was respected by students and his students tried their best in his math class.
10/12/16, 4:58 PM - Imran Farhat: True but the others were just a bit too frustrated and that was quite obvoius from their actions.
Specially Sir Rasheed
10/12/16, 5:40 PM - Ziad Asghar: This one is awesome ...

A driver was stuck in a traffic jam on the road outside Parliament, Islamabad.

Suddenly, a man knocks on the window.
The driver rolls down the window and asks,"What's going on?"
"Terrorists have kidnapped the entire Pakistani politicians , and they're asking for a $100 million dollar ransom.
Otherwise, they're going to douse them all in petrol and set them on fire. We're going from car to car, collecting donations".

"How much is everyone giving, on an average?" the driver asks...

The man replies, "Roughly 2 litres."

10/14/16, 7:04 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: because if we believe then we are out of Islam
10/14/16, 7:04 PM - Faisal Farooqi: It is like Nostradamus who made some generic predictions and folks now interpret it any way they like
10/14/16, 7:04 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: and if we go just for enquiry then prayer will not be accepted for 40 days
10/14/16, 7:06 PM - Saifullah Inayat: First of all why media spread such things
10/14/16, 7:06 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Well, in this case Dr Shahid Masood is talking about specific preditions, on events which already occurred in the past
10/14/16, 7:06 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I consider it just a way to drum up publicity for the program

10/14/16, 10:45 PM - Shakil Ahmed: did you guys ever visit him in Cyprus?
10/14/16, 10:46 PM - Shakil Ahmed: in Lefke

10/14/16, 10:48 PM - Shakil Ahmed: i thought there was one univ.
10/14/16, 10:50 PM - Faisal Farooqi: yes, most of us were in Eastern Mediterranean University in Gazi Magosa
10/14/16, 10:50 PM - Shakil Ahmed: I have some live videos... once I performed with him on stage
10/14/16, 10:50 PM - Shakil Ahmed: oh EMU
10/14/16, 10:50 PM - Faisal Farooqi: then later on some transferred or went directly to Near East University in Lefkosa which was the capital city
10/14/16, 10:51 PM - Shakil Ahmed: what was the other one?
10/14/16, 10:51 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üëçüëç
10/14/16, 10:51 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Lefkosa...that's where the airport is?
10/14/16, 10:51 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Qasim was the only one during our time who went to University of Lefke, he wanted to study architecture and Lefke was the only one who offered an established Architecture program at the time
10/14/16, 10:52 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Correct, Ercan airport is by Lefkosa
10/14/16, 10:53 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Amir Aslam, Asif, Rao Shehzad were in Near East University in Lefkosa
10/14/16, 11:03 PM - Ziad Asghar: Isn't kabbani

10/14/16, 11:04 PM - Ziad Asghar: US
10/14/16, 11:05 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes
10/14/16, 11:05 PM - Ziad Asghar: I don't appreciate that..
10/14/16, 11:06 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Robert Spencer and his small study
10/14/16, 11:09 PM - Ziad Asghar: Are the 2 affiliated??
10/14/16, 11:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: i think so
10/14/16, 11:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: i remember some argument involving Reza Aslan

10/14/16, 11:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/80-of-american-mosques
10/14/16, 11:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: check this
10/14/16, 11:12 PM - Ziad Asghar: Robert was using Kabbani statement for his hateful agenda.
10/14/16, 11:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Yes, just googled that too.  Not a fan of either..
10/14/16, 11:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: I think from outside the Saudi influence is perceived as all encompassing the US Islamic landscape
10/14/16, 11:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: which is not the case
10/14/16, 11:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: In Ghazali's time the two camps were fighting each other like today
10/14/16, 11:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: he tried to pull them ti a middle ground
10/14/16, 11:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: he tried his best
10/14/16, 11:17 PM - Ziad Asghar: We have enough haters without our own helping them out further..
10/14/16, 11:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: true
10/14/16, 11:18 PM - Mashood Yunus: Correct
10/14/16, 11:22 PM - Faisal Farooqi: But Robert says on his website that he is a nice guy. It is on the internet so it must be true üôÑ
10/14/16, 11:24 PM - Mashood Yunus: haters like spencer, geller and stece emerson, all in same league
10/14/16, 11:25 PM - Shakil Ahmed: http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/media-center/domestic-extremism/63-islamic-extremism-a-viable-threat-to-us-national-security.html
10/14/16, 11:25 PM - Shakil Ahmed: this is the transcript of Sh. Hisham Kabbani's speach... in 1999 ....
10/14/16, 11:25 PM - Shakil Ahmed: later Sheikh Hisham explained what he meant by 80%
10/14/16, 11:28 PM - Ziad Asghar: What did he mean?
10/14/16, 11:29 PM - Mashood Yunus: He caused plenty of problems for muslims themselves
10/14/16, 11:29 PM - Ziad Asghar: Trying to give benefit of the doubt..
10/14/16, 11:30 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Questioner (continued): One other question that is about the mosques in this country. You say that 80% of them are run by the extremists, I wonder what you mean by that.
Shaykh Kabbani: 80% of them have been being run by the extremist ideology, but not acting as a militant movement. We don't know if this will lead in the future to be more in the hands of militant extremism or not. There are two kinds of extremism: there is the extremism ideology and there is the extremist militant movement. In the future some of them might be working or affiliating themselves with such kinds of militant extremism.
Questioner (continued): You said, on the other hand, that most American Muslims are peace loving, yet their mosques are being run by these extremists?
Shaykh Kabbani: Muslims, in general, are peace loving and tolerant. And a Muslim likes to go and find a place to go and make his service, make his worship and go and doesn't interfere. So the board of trustees of these mosques is being run by these extremists.
10/14/16, 11:31 PM - Mashood Yunus: He raised the doubts which were used by non muslims later on. May allah guide him
10/14/16, 11:32 PM - Ziad Asghar: Hardly a good explanation.
10/14/16, 11:32 PM - Ziad Asghar: And he seems to stand by his wrong assertion.
10/14/16, 11:33 PM - Ziad Asghar: Like zealots, his point is if people don't follow him then they are out.
10/14/16, 11:33 PM - Ziad Asghar: Selling out and maligning 80% of the mosques with such a broad brush is plain wrong.
10/14/16, 11:35 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Does not look like a good explanation to me. More of if one does not agree with him they are in the 80%
10/14/16, 11:35 PM - Mashood Yunus: Although the "80%" figure has been widely cited by public officials, and has been repeated by several other reports,it has not been confirmed by a quantitative, peer-reviewed study
10/14/16, 11:35 PM - Ziad Asghar: Exactly
10/14/16, 11:36 PM - Mashood Yunus: Sadly, haters  got something to cling on from the Muslim Camp itself so they made use of theat number as much as they could
10/14/16, 11:36 PM - Faisal Farooqi: He also did not describe what he meant with the extremist ideology...
10/14/16, 11:37 PM - Mashood Yunus: When I had read this it was before 911 and then after 9/11 this number was hurting so much especially in the articles for the quotations such as enemy of our enemy is our friend
10/14/16, 11:38 PM - Shakil Ahmed: that's sad
10/14/16, 11:38 PM - Faisal Farooqi: That word is a negative word in general, just like fundamental has been converted to a negative term
10/14/16, 11:38 PM - Mashood Yunus: Yeah ...
10/14/16, 11:39 PM - Shakil Ahmed: extremist ideolgy.. fundamentalism... all abused words
10/14/16, 11:40 PM - Shakil Ahmed: extremist ideology is when you take extreme interpretation of tradition
10/14/16, 11:41 PM - Mashood Yunus: It is important that we keep our ideological differences within our house so that  haters do not get a chance to hurt us, by pitting us against each other
10/14/16, 11:41 PM - Mashood Yunus: May Allah have mercy on all the Muslims
10/14/16, 11:41 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood...yes
10/14/16, 11:41 PM - Mashood Yunus: Haters need to see that when they will attack us we will put our united front regardless of our differences
10/14/16, 11:41 PM - Shakil Ahmed: aameen
10/14/16, 11:42 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Yeh Pakistan or UAE mein weekend kab start ho ga?
10/14/16, 11:43 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Everyone is missing in action

10/14/16, 11:43 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Maybe we start talking about chocolate to bring Ahmer back
10/14/16, 11:45 PM - Mashood Yunus: Chocolate with mocha chocolate coffee with coffee cake
10/14/16, 11:45 PM - Mashood Yunus: After that all become diabetic, end of the party ...

10/14/16, 11:54 PM - Mashood Yunus: Change of topic
10/14/16, 11:54 PM - Mashood Yunus: Fessor do you still make the backups of our discussions do you have some earlier ones from the very start of the group
10/14/16, 11:55 PM - Mashood Yunus: Fessor = faisal
10/14/16, 11:57 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I have the earlier one, did not make one after it

10/15/16, 12:04 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes, feeling stupid doing that but I want to relive the excitenent of the day, I woke up to find 598 messgaes and I was like what the heck
10/15/16, 12:05 AM - Mashood Yunus: Usually my sibling can generate 200 messages among 5 of them but finding 600 messages blew me away
10/15/16, 12:05 AM - Mashood Yunus: But.since then, I have done enough damage alone and must be caused by many of you
10/15/16, 12:05 AM - Mashood Yunus: CUsed = cussed
10/15/16, 12:06 AM - Shakil Ahmed: we should have taken screen shots

10/15/16, 12:08 AM - Mashood Yunus: Really

10/15/16, 12:11 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yeah I know and I see all the text from 16th of September until today including all the messages and all the icons but it is not very readable because I think you'll have to write some kind of sorter or Whatsapp email reader
10/15/16, 12:12 AM - Mashood Yunus: We will
10/15/16, 12:12 AM - Ziad Asghar: Aren't you a SW guy??

10/15/16, 12:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: I think we just need to be able to add a line break right before each date and then this should be readable
10/15/16, 12:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: Actually let me try to open the file in Microsoft Word instead of notepad and see what happens
10/15/16, 12:15 AM - Ziad Asghar: Don't need a script.  It is mashood

10/15/16, 12:32 AM - Mashood Yunus: My file says media ommitted because I chose to.save messages without media
10/15/16, 12:33 AM - Mashood Yunus: For this file alone, I will need to write the unique line parser first

Wife to Husband...

I am going to My Mom's Place for 6-7 days with kids &
These are the instructions and warning for you. . 

1 - No need to call your friends and cousins. 
Last time I got 4 large pizza bills beneath the sofa... 

2 - Don't forget mobile on the soap holder in the bathroom like last time... 
Why would anyone need a mobile in the bathroom.?? 

3 - Keep your specs in the box.. 
Last time around it was found in the refrigerator. 

4 - Salary already paid to maid. 
No need to be extra generous.

5 - Don't disturb neighbors early in the morning asking if they have got newspaper or not?? 
Our newspaper vendor is different from theirs.. 
And our laundry person and milkman are also different. 

6 - Your Underwear are on left side of wardrobe and on right side are kid's...
Like last time, don't say I was uncomfortable at work....

7 - All reports have been checked and you are alright.  
No need to go to that lady doctor again and again.  

8 - My sister and Bhabhi's birthdays have  gone last month which you already attended.  
No need to go to them at midnight and wish belated happy birthday.. 

9 - Have cut off WiFi for 10 days. 
So sleep early.... 

10 - Stop smiling and being happy... 
as Mrs. Chaudhry, Mrs. Awan, Mrs. Khan, Mrs. Malik, Mrs. Ansari, Mrs. Sharif, Mrs. Khattak... 
They all will be out of station in this period.... 

And last but not the least.

11 - Don't try to be oversmart.. 
I will be back anytime without informing you

I was fed up with being burgled every other day in my neighbourhood. So, I tore out my alarm system & de-registered from our local Neighbourhood Watch.
I've planted a large Black Flag of ISIS in the centre of my garden.
Now, the Yorkshire police, the National Security Bureau, Scotland Yard, MI-5, MI-6, the CIA and every other intelligence service in Europe are all watching my house 24x7x365.
My children are followed to school every day and my wife when she goes shopping. I'm followed to and from work every day. So no one bothers me at all.
I have never felt safer.

*ÔøºIf someone acts on any of this information, you will benefit too.*


*Quran* as cure. . . Good things to know.

*3 important & beneficial thngs:*


*1.Hazrat Muhammad s.a.w. Says that if a person recites Ayatul Qursi after every Farz Namaz then there will be nothing between him & heaven except death.*

May *ALLAH*clear all your worries.


Did u know if u do wudhu before going to bed, your soul goes to *Allah SWT* and does sajda. *Allah SWT* then appoints an angel to stand next to your bed and everytime you move he makes dua for your forgiveness. So do wudhu before bedtime and pass on the message. Only takes 1 minute to do!!

The prolongation of prostration strengthens memory, and prevents stroke.

Prostration removes positive charges in the body - in a world where EVERYTHING uses electricity and affects us negatively, learn the importance of this.

10/22/16, 7:12 AM - Imran Farhat: It took me quite a while to collect all the dust which was wiped off from the past few 30 year old memories by few of our geniuses today.
On the first look at the number of whatsapp saying 700 plus , I thought I shall read them like the old school text book but some how I ended up reading all of those 700 plus messages with real free childhood memories refreshed .
Many commentable messages from Aqeel , Zayad, Faisal , Mashhood , Adnan , Salahuddin, Inam ,Waseem, Aroosh, Saif, Amir and others if I am forgetting any, but if I start commenting then it will be be an add of not less than 100 messages which I think is not a good idea .
Great memories.

You relax in an aeroplane though you do not know the pilot, 

You relax in a ship though you do not know the captain, 

You relax in the train without knowing the motorman,

You relax in the bus not knowing the driver,

why don't you relax in your life while you know that Allah is its controller?

Trust your lord. 
He is the best plannerüòä

Let her call
My sister is a doctor 
I will simply say that a severly tormented woman with a lot of personality issues is calling to check on her prescription 

Than they will all pray for her

That empty bed could be put to use for someone who gets charmingly aroused by a sick woman üòúüòú

Konsa alim hai dunya may jo sood ( jis ka kum say kum gunah Maa k sath zina K beraber hai )Huzur saw nay fermaya,mafhoom hai. 

Ko jaiz qarar day , gulen sood k haq may hai.

10/25/16, 7:55 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: lil
10/25/16, 7:55 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: lol
10/25/16, 7:56 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Amrold he is typing again
10/25/16, 7:57 AM - Imran Farhat: I can see him typing but just wondering what is taking so long to deliverüòâ
10/25/16, 7:57 AM - Faraz Kashif: Mashood lost his keyboard
Has to type the good old fashion way 
On the phone itself üòä
10/25/16, 7:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: I totally agree with this.  I am making a suggestion in good spirits and I pray May Allah enable me to explain myself with clarity. It is just a suggestion and u can all feel free to totally ignore it.  I mean no offence. I request u to read it all before responding. 

 People should have liberty to raise any topic but both sides should also hear each other out like we usually do alhamdulillah. For example, in political topics, the news clippings from amer have full support from me but I also see some valid points in what aqeel and ahmer say and answers should be shared for mutual mental enlightenment. I want to hear both sides and *I love it* if I do not agree with other party.  However IF naveed or Faraz kashif or shakil or adnan or haroon or any of the monitors (I explained this idea in next paragraph) ... *anyone else wants to drop topic*, I and other group should respect and drop the topic respecting others wishes. We can move the topic to political forum created 3 weeks ago.  

We might raise the issue another day and might have to drop it again using same process but at least we will have a process in place. 

So I also suggest we choose few "monitors" who be authorized and respected so they can remind us to *drop* the topic.  For example when a deeper political discussion starts smelling  of serious disagreements, this "monitor" be able to have the topic dropped.  ... And from what we know so far, during political discussion, I or amir or aqeel or ahmer cannot be monitors we need shakil or faraz or ali or .... To step in as monitors.  

Similarly I will love to be monitor for the jokes sessions üòà because  R and XXX rated jokes were posted in past few days but some of u must decide if I should be monitor, not me ...

I hope I made sense
10/25/16, 7:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: keyboard buffer filled up
10/25/16, 7:59 AM - Imran Farhat: Sorry but keyboard is old fashion and handheld devices are the latest with extra options we can blame üòÇ
10/25/16, 8:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: Wrong ... I and my wife read each and every one of them, even if we might not agree with each line :)
10/25/16, 8:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Please add sensitivities of ppl of other faiths in our group. The barrage came in response to that insensitivity. Like Faisal many others dont care for the posts since we never read them.
10/25/16, 8:02 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Continue brother...
10/25/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Rasulullah SAW has disowned ppl who dont care for minorities
10/25/16, 8:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hope this is kept in view in future
10/25/16, 8:07 AM - Mashood Yunus: I totally agree about respecting other faiths who are clearly known.  I do not think anyone disagrees on this. If it needs to be spelled out like how u said it, I am fine with it.  Thx aqeel
10/25/16, 8:08 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üëç yep needs to be since ppl are oblivious to it.
10/25/16, 8:08 AM - Mashood Yunus: Faraz, IMRAN, aqeel and shakil are so so fuuny in your keyboard comments.  Heheheeeeee

10/25/16, 8:22 AM - Mashood Yunus: I am a not-so-proud member of these messages . The topic is not so halaal but I was not so halaal in larakpan and manhoos aqeel knew this, his innocent comment to an innocent picture posted by me caused this mini toofaan. I have enjoyed the ⁄Ü⁄æÿ™ÿ±ŸàŸÑ, ŸàÿßŸπÿåŸÜŸà€åÿØ ⁄©€å flying ŸæŸéŸæ€åÿß⁄∫ .  thx for awesome contributions from ziad, adnan, faisal (teeli badshah), shakil, haroon, aqeel and who did I miss?
10/25/16, 8:24 AM - Imran Farhat: MashaAllah 52 not 51.
Yes it's true this group is so tempting that what ever I try but can't skip any message other then the political ones which I politely ignore . I  try my level best to interfere with my jokes orüëÜüèªwhich mostly doesn't work with the serious discussion but still Aadat say majboor.
10/25/16, 8:25 AM - Mashood Yunus: I forgot to add emojis on last reply. To show that I also enjoyed the session and providing entertainment, heheheee

Hehehee , so I will inform u separately when we talk on the phone.  ALLAH karay, aqeel yeh parh lay aur us ko khoob aag, angaaray, chingaariyan or sholay lag jain.  Khabees ko poori raat neend na aye aur din bhar chain na paray.

10/25/16, 1:00 PM - Mashood Yunus: of course, dua needed for many years to come.  I have visited Jeddah 4 times in past 12 years .. have an american friend theere who was involved with leadership of an english medium islamic school (al Andulas), jeddah also has a good (if not great) dawah team project and my relative tells great things about Pakistani school (with all its problems, it still has quite islamic mindset) - so I can only do my best to plan and move for Haram, for our parents, Muminah or our own self (sadaf was raised in KSA partly, in riyadh so she is quite comfrotable moving there).  Rest is up to Allah (swt)  .. whatever he wills!  so asking you for a very long term dua ... for years to come :)

10/25/16, 7:44 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: Once upon a time .. a small boy named Basheer lived in a tiny Pakistani village. All his classmates hated him for his stupidity especially his teacher who was always yelling at him "you are driving me crazy Basheer"...

One day his mother went to check out how he is doing at school and the teacher told her honestly that her son is simply a disaster, getting very low marks and never had she seen such a dumb boy in her whole career...

The mother could not accept such a feed back and she took her son out from that school. she even shifted to another city ...

25 years later, that teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors have advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform..

Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful ...when she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling to her, being under anesthesia effect, she wanted to thank him but could not talk, in turn, he was staring at her face which started turning blue, she was raising her hand trying to tell him some thing but in vain and eventually died...

The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, till he turned back and saw our friend Basheer working as a cleaner in that hospital who had unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner......      
                 
If you were thinking that Basheer became a doctor, its because you have been watching too many movies, serials or have read too many motivational forwarded messages.. üòÇ
10/25/16, 7:48 PM - Shakil Ahmed: motivational

10/26/16, 3:29 PM - Mashood Yunus: Hah, thx so much ...
10/26/16, 3:29 PM - Mashood Yunus: Hehe
10/26/16, 3:32 PM - Mashood Yunus: So I had to get meningitis renewal shot for ksa, as well as malaria (low risk). Rest of the shots are for pakistan and there were 6 of them as well as two pills for malaria and cholera, I think.  Daughter got some extra ones , being a child.
10/26/16, 3:36 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: Prophylaxis pills or a vaccine shot for Malaria?
10/26/16, 3:39 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: There is now a vaccine for malaria for kids available in Europe, not sure about US...but not yet available in Canada. The prophylaxis Malaria pills have weird side-effects
10/26/16, 3:43 PM - Mashood Yunus: She gave us larium for malaria and it has wierd dreams.side effect. Two other pills were the option but they were too expensive
10/26/16, 3:45 PM - Mashood Yunus: I have been to Pakistan each of the past four years and didn't really come to the Travel Clinic as much except last year because we weren't for umrah and so for next year when to Travel Clinic again because we are planning another umrah, just to make sure we stay healthy somehow
10/26/16, 3:46 PM - Mashood Yunus: But it seems they used the opportunity to give us all kind of vaccines anything which was due later now hepatitis cholera chicken pox rabies polio etc, all in 4 shots

10/26/16, 4:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: dubai best option
10/26/16, 4:27 PM - Mashood Yunus: aqeel, all of our countries are victims of our own rudness and lack of application of Islam and it has directly benefitted our enemies, USA specifically and west in general.  like you had said, it is an age of deception.  like naveed had said, muslims are rudest to each other
10/26/16, 4:27 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yep but u have some priorities
10/26/16, 4:28 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: ie family
10/26/16, 4:28 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: ur health
10/26/16, 4:29 PM - Mashood Yunus: we all have lived pretty good life in 1970s in UAE and other GCC areas.  all of our countries including pakistan, KSA and UAE are victims of lack of islamic identity and when you lose that identity, all sorts of problems are happening (such as their foreign policy dictating our interior and foreign policies)
10/26/16, 4:30 PM - Mashood Yunus: yes I have my priorities but Allah has not treated me unfairly for all these years.  if there is some pain written in my life, alHamdulillah but I also need to do what is best for my spirits
10/26/16, 4:30 PM - Mashood Yunus: I do not have anything else to say :)
10/26/16, 4:31 PM - Mashood Yunus: just like we had great life in 1970 inshallah it will be better in future yaar.  keep making dua for me.
10/26/16, 4:31 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Ameen
10/26/16, 4:31 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: living and working are two different things
10/26/16, 4:31 PM - Mashood Yunus: I am thankful we are seeing leaders like in turkey, who besides all their human shortcoming, stand up for Islam and I pray it happens in other countries too.
10/26/16, 4:34 PM - Mashood Yunus: i know aqeel but we have to spend some of our warm blood, and sweat in our Muslim lands too.  before the old age hits.  '
10/26/16, 4:34 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üëç
10/26/16, 4:35 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: its your turn
10/26/16, 4:35 PM - Mashood Yunus: insha-Allah :)
10/26/16, 4:42 PM - Mashood Yunus: what you contributed will also return to you in good way.  I am mainly going for Haram and I think I had mentioned that when we talked in mid september.  I also have to start building a home in Pakistan. Wife's parents are quite sick and being around them is important.  all these people supported us while we stayed in USA and lived our lives to support ourselves and our dawah work, now their old age requires us to be with them in few years so we are just starting to prepare.  i also have my fears but I have to stand up to them because Allah has been so kind to me for all these years, i have no reason to believe He will not be in future. My heart cries for Palestine and I want to do my share of making dua for them, change something if I can - I have done that living in USA and i want to continue doing that, just like many non Muslims (such as Flotilla ones) and Muslims and only one muslim leader (like erdogan) has done. Saudi politics is not my goal and neither will be.  Allah is and insha-Allah will remain to be.  You need to keep making dua and that is what I am requesting you.
10/26/16, 4:43 PM - Mashood Yunus: I have two presentations in few hours and you will also make dua for me for that, right ... love you for sake of Allah
10/26/16, 4:54 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Need to support your loved ones. I left the US for the same reason. All the best
10/26/16, 4:55 PM - Mashood Yunus: thanks yaar.  i know, tu pyaaraa yaar hay and you mean well yaar
10/26/16, 4:59 PM - Faisal Farooqi: There are difficulties in life, each country has a different set. We just need to learn to live with them.
10/26/16, 4:59 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: true
10/26/16, 5:01 PM - Mashood Yunus: true

10/28/16, 7:10 AM - Amir A. Sattar: i am realy sick and tired of your comments i can not be part of such disscusion
10/28/16, 7:11 AM - Amir A. Sattar: one more comment about any country and i will leave the group ,can not japordise my future and as well of my family listining to fools like u
10/28/16, 7:16 AM - Amir A. Sattar: <Media omitted>
10/28/16, 7:19 AM - Asif Iqbal: did u got any fush
10/28/16, 7:19 AM - Asif Iqbal: fish
10/28/16, 7:35 AM - Amir A. Sattar: not yet bro
10/28/16, 7:48 AM - Asif Iqbal: good lucküëç
10/28/16, 7:53 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Guys this group was created to discuss and share important matters.

We all have access to so called world wide web. Everything posted on web are not always important to be shared accross the group.

Let us stick to the important issues.

Im sure we all agree.
10/28/16, 8:04 AM - Amir A. Sattar: üëç
10/28/16, 8:12 AM - Waseem Choudry: Aoa bros
10/28/16, 8:18 AM - Waseem Choudry: üëÜ
10/28/16, 8:27 AM - Mashood Yunus: Walqikum assalam br waseem, and everyone else :)
10/28/16, 8:35 AM - Mashood Yunus: Br amir and br abdul Hafeez. Thanks for bringing up your concerns.  May Allah reward you abundantly.  I ask, very respectfully, if you could expand a bit on what you mean. It will truly help me as I am often naming countries too

amir was  clear that he does not want to hear any comments about countries.  So amir, do u think we should avoid naming names of any countries or just specific countries (I have general idea which names should be avoided so u do not need to give me names)

Br abdul hafeez, I think I get your point but if u could point us to couple of examples of what should NOT  be posted from WWW, I will truly appreciate.  Were u pointing to youtube as well or just postings from news sites.

This will truly help people like me when I type my posts and be careful about what I post as I do not wish to jeopardize anyone
10/28/16, 9:13 AM - Faraz Kashif: Salaam buddy

Just skip what you dont like üòä
I have been doing it and its been working just fine for me 
Have to filter messages since guys like to discuss everything here 

Its not just one person, its almost all of us üòÅ
10/28/16, 9:25 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I have a good idea of what Amir spoke about and I think I know what Abdul Hafeez was referring to.
10/28/16, 9:26 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Name calling each other, a group of people/country or someone one quoted as a reference does not suit any one of us
10/28/16, 9:27 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Well maybe we can make an exception for Modi, Indian army and Trump üòÄ
10/28/16, 9:29 AM - Faisal Farooqi: It is impossible for ~50 people to hold similar views even when we take into account that we were class fellows
10/28/16, 9:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: does that mean, I cannot use all my favourite words such as Kameenay, Kharoos, Manhoos, Khabees and luchay anymore?
10/28/16, 9:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: so diversity is power and I cherish that ... as long as this diversity doesn't  male us cross limits set by Allah swt (that is true for anything actually). ...
10/28/16, 9:33 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Mashiod I know you use them in jest but others may not
10/28/16, 9:33 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Similarly if one can say them while being funny why can't others say that when they are angry üòÄ
10/28/16, 9:34 AM - Faraz Kashif: Yaar Amir
That is UNCALLED for...... üòî

It starts here and has no end 
Mutual respect is what will keep this group intact..... üëç

I am not talking on someone's behalf but rather take this in general my dear friend
10/28/16, 9:36 AM - Faraz Kashif: Mashood aap kay chahetay words aaj say BANNED hain

Others will use it in different context ....
10/28/16, 9:37 AM - Faraz Kashif: üòâ
10/28/16, 9:37 AM - Faisal Farooqi: In my opinion Respect, Tolerance and Moderation are three key aspects we all should hold on to
10/28/16, 9:37 AM - Faraz Kashif: Agreed üëç
10/28/16, 9:38 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Respect each other when we are have a discussion where we hold different opinion, this means no name calling.
10/28/16, 9:39 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Tolerate the opinion of others, difference of opinion is a given on a group of this size.
10/28/16, 9:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: :(  well i guess, that was needed.  I will need to find another group to use those words, where I can be really myself üòà, that is for this group.  you will not get as many messages from me any more since I cannot be my true (evil) self in this group anymore.  *Talk to my hand* from here on ....
10/28/16, 9:40 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Moderation of sending jokes, news, emojis, etc
10/28/16, 9:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: that is good for this group, finally a way to control me :)
10/28/16, 9:40 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Nai bhai Rak maen koi baarish nai ho le rai
10/28/16, 9:41 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Moderation can be kept aside while sending scans of photos from school days... üòá
10/28/16, 9:41 AM - Faraz Kashif: I agree ...
Mashhood if you use it with love and with a good heart
Than how can we stop someone from using them when they are upset
10/28/16, 9:42 AM - Mashood Yunus: has anyone uses my chaheetay words when they are angry
10/28/16, 9:42 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Na jalebi bai ab itna bhi nai chorne ka. Hum log to idhar Rak maen geezar chla k nahate haen
10/28/16, 9:43 AM - Mashood Yunus: so far, I have not seen anyone using them, they seem to be unique to me only :)  heheh.   in anger people tend to use more offending words (and alhamdulillah I do not use any of them)    but at any rate, I will start controlling my chaheetay words insha-Allah.
10/28/16, 9:44 AM - Mashood Yunus: Thanks for the awesome guidelines *Faisal* and nice back up *Faraz* (tumhain to main dekh loon gaa, bus aanay do mujhay UAE)
10/28/16, 9:45 AM - Faraz Kashif: Yaar you know what you sound like ??.......
10/28/16, 9:46 AM - Faraz Kashif: <Media omitted>
10/28/16, 9:47 AM - Mashood Yunus: a jaani dushman!
10/28/16, 9:47 AM - Kashif Jabbar: Pehle apni date of birth bataye phir baat hogi
10/28/16, 9:47 AM - Faraz Kashif: Love you Mashhood and waiting on you buddy....
10/28/16, 9:47 AM - Mashood Yunus: haha faraz, still a jaani dushman.  I am so glad, we both have no *difference of opinion* about that.
10/28/16, 9:48 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Anyways I will end my rant by saying that Ziad and I started this group to bring us together and not to create difference among us. I would not want to be a part of this if this group ends up being the source of fights and animosity.
10/28/16, 9:52 AM - Abdul Hafeez: sorry guys... was bit occupied with the kids..
What Faisal said ... are my views too.
10/28/16, 9:53 AM - Faraz Kashif: I see huge longterm benefits from this group when we retire in our old ages.....
10/28/16, 9:54 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Mashoud I suppose you can still use your specific comments and words and we will close our eyes !!
10/28/16, 9:54 AM - Mashood Yunus: I think being blunt is important (like amir baloch did) and advising each other is important did (like abdul hafeez did).  It is good to set limits and guidelines as all of us in this group are still learning (like faisal did). It is important to remind me of my boundaries (like faisal and faraz did üò≠ and now they are on my hit list).  Rest is fine. You are doing great. There will be animosity  inshallah, difference of opinion will remain ... Sadly ... Because ... Let me not go there ....  *you are doing a great job, please do not go anywhere, stay in this group please*
10/28/16, 9:55 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Baap ray... Hit List !!
10/28/16, 9:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: hehe
10/28/16, 9:56 AM - Faraz Kashif: You are safe Adbul Hafeez ...
Apparently he doesnt like names that start with *F*
10/28/16, 9:56 AM - Abdul Hafeez: he he...
10/28/16, 9:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: I will be entering a prison facility soon for a discussion with captives about Islam so if I do not write, please do not think i am upset of any sort.  I truly truly loved the commetns from br Abdul Hafeez, Faisal and Faraz and on serious note, although br Abdul Hafeez you are so accomodating :)  I will watch my words and posts and try to ensure I am careful! :)  love you all for sake of God!
10/28/16, 9:57 AM - Mashood Yunus: cell phones are not allowed inside :)
10/28/16, 9:57 AM - Mashood Yunus: but unity is group is important so I wanted to share the views before I disappear :)
10/28/16, 9:59 AM - Faraz Kashif: More power to you buddy..
*Nice work* 

May Allah give Hidayah to them and use you as a source *(sabab)* for it 
*Ameen*
10/28/16, 10:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: ameen :)
10/28/16, 10:04 AM - Faraz Kashif: I remember our masjid use to send out regular delegations to Prison facilities and a lot of success rate from inmates Embrassing Islam
10/28/16, 10:08 AM - Kashif Jabbar: Bhai tension nahi lene ka abhi aloo bhai ko sapari dene ka tapka dalne ka

10/29/16, 10:53 AM - Mashood Yunus: sharam karo amir -
10/29/16, 10:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: something to reflect :) have we lost this much sensitivity to "alcohol" that we will invite people to such songs which glorify "um ul Khabaaes".  and I am sure, you all know, this is not from me ... this is from Allah (swt).  this should be a boundary for each of us at personal, family and community level
10/29/16, 10:55 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar its just a beautifull ghazal , thats it nothing moreüò¨üò¨üò¨
10/29/16, 10:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: jaldi jaldi typing khatam karo, i cannot wait to read your response
10/29/16, 10:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: :)  Ok magar Amir
10/29/16, 10:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: songs and music are a much smaller sin
10/29/16, 10:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: but Alcohol ----
10/29/16, 10:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: I request please let us not have us all face this on day of judgement
10/29/16, 10:56 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar abhi to public is cheez par lar rahi hai ka koun si sharab haram hai ?
10/29/16, 10:57 AM - Mashood Yunus: Your brother asking you  to not ingore this
10/29/16, 10:57 AM - Mashood Yunus: I am not sure who is fighting about it :)  but I and you are very clear that it is haram, regardless of our action about it
10/29/16, 10:57 AM - Amir A. Sattar: its not that i am encouraging any body to engage drinking
10/29/16, 10:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: ok - perfect.
10/29/16, 10:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: that is established now.
10/29/16, 10:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: thanks much my lovely brother
10/29/16, 11:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: anytime, we glamorize, publicise these haram elements (be it alcohol, halloween etc.), indirectly we make other insensitive to their abundance and their impact - bringing them one step closer
10/29/16, 11:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: alhamdulillah, I know this is not your purpose too.  thanks my brother
10/29/16, 11:00 AM - Amir A. Sattar: no doubt that sharab is um al khabais
10/29/16, 11:01 AM - Shakil Ahmed: üëç
10/29/16, 11:01 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood.. I am glad you used the word.... insesitivee
10/29/16, 11:02 AM - Shakil Ahmed: insensitive
10/29/16, 11:02 AM - Amir A. Sattar: mashoud look around u you will find this stuff all around you specially now adayz
10/29/16, 11:02 AM - Mashood Yunus: alhamdulillah, i have someone like you who allows to say and who listen and who is kind.  Thanks so much Amir.
10/29/16, 11:02 AM - Mashood Yunus: I agree Amir and it will keep increasing but at least you can care about me and Shakil and I can care about you and shakil
10/29/16, 11:02 AM - Amir A. Sattar: bro you are right though
10/29/16, 11:03 AM - Shakil Ahmed: the thing is that... each one has different sensitivity to same things
10/29/16, 11:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: everyone has to answer for their deeds. at least I can say, oh Allah, this is the company i kept (shakil, Amir) and they were my support and not pushing me to this
10/29/16, 11:03 AM - Amir A. Sattar: i care about every one
10/29/16, 11:03 AM - Mashood Yunus: You do, Iknow
10/29/16, 11:04 AM - Mashood Yunus: and sooner and later, you will find something where i want you to pick me and help me
10/29/16, 11:04 AM - Mashood Yunus: We all need those kind of people in our lives :)
10/29/16, 11:05 AM - Amir A. Sattar: as the prophet said if any body will ask to answer about any thing on the day of judgement will be a grave day for him
10/29/16, 11:05 AM - Shakil Ahmed: I may be more tolerant and focused to music than others.... ignoring the bad lyrics.....
10/29/16, 11:05 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes Amir
10/29/16, 11:05 AM - Mashood Yunus: and see I am not calling you Br Amir :)
10/29/16, 11:05 AM - Shakil Ahmed: or take some different meaning from same lyrics
10/29/16, 11:05 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar islam is not that though
10/29/16, 11:07 AM - Amir A. Sattar: you can enjoy the beautifull things in life including poetry which are songs offcourse and music
10/29/16, 11:08 AM - Faraz Kashif: üëç
Same here 
Individuals perception is a big key factor in this arena
10/29/16, 11:08 AM - Amir A. Sattar: its up to a person if he wants to take out bad things out of good things and good things out of bad
10/29/16, 11:08 AM - Shakil Ahmed: but caution is must...
10/29/16, 11:09 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Shaitaan attcks you from least expected
10/29/16, 11:09 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar let to scholors fight it out between themselves which is allowed and what is not allowed
10/29/16, 11:10 AM - Shakil Ahmed: and we should not shut people off who remind us....
10/29/16, 11:10 AM - Amir A. Sattar: for me being a simple person like to enjoy every thing üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
10/29/16, 11:10 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes... buy we should pick a way for us... whichever we agree with
10/29/16, 11:11 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Amir.... u r great bro
10/29/16, 11:11 AM - Mashood Yunus: My focus was alcohol and we agreed there alhamdulillah.  I will not make any comments about Music.  we look at practice of Prophet (pbuh) and our companions and that should be enough.  On day of judgement if these arguments (which shakil and faraz have made) can be used for justification, then so be it. I am free from them and you are free from my reasoning
10/29/16, 11:12 AM - Mashood Yunus: and you are all great in the end because you all recognize truth, alhamdulillah
10/29/16, 11:12 AM - Adnan Ali: But Sri Devi is not Haram ü§îü§îü§î
10/29/16, 11:12 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... that's great...
10/29/16, 11:12 AM - Imran Farhat: Amir is a singer who sings without music.
Sir is this haram too?ü§î
10/29/16, 11:13 AM - Mashood Yunus: awesome point Imrah - that helps me a lot to listen to him
10/29/16, 11:13 AM - Mashood Yunus: although I have yet to qualify his lyrics, heheheee
10/29/16, 11:13 AM - Mashood Yunus: Adnan, Teri tau ....
10/29/16, 11:13 AM - Adnan Ali: Poetry is allowed
10/29/16, 11:13 AM - Mashood Yunus: of course, as long as lyrics are good which is sadly not true for a signifincant amount in past many years
10/29/16, 11:14 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yaaro... if we paint everything  with broad brushes... nothing is allowed
10/29/16, 11:14 AM - Mashood Yunus: mere hathoon say bach jaa Adnan, I will fly in ... BTW where do you live *adnan*, zara bataana tau
10/29/16, 11:14 AM - Shakil Ahmed: even chatting on Whatsapp
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: Prphet pbuh used Audio Video tools so as long as we use them correctly, we can surely use them
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: for good purposes Shakil
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: He drew on sand to make his points - Aides are helpful
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Shakil Ahmed: it's not allowed for wrong purpose,
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: correct
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Mashood Yunus: agree with shakil
10/29/16, 11:15 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood Allah aap ko kushh rakhay
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: thanks for kind words
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: wish the same for you
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Adnan Ali: Joke apart poetry is allowed and music with out poetry is also allowed
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: all of you you actually
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: Adnan, awesome style of asking
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Mashood Yunus: Poetry with good lyrics is definitely allowed
10/29/16, 11:16 AM - Shakil Ahmed: you can extrapolate other thing from same analogy
10/29/16, 11:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: I have never read of Prophet and companions enjoying music with or without poetry, except with a single sided duff at a wedding occasion.
10/29/16, 11:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: Abu Bakr (RA) tried to stop singing women but Prophet (pbuh) stopped him and
10/29/16, 11:18 AM - Imran Farhat: Bohot mushkil songs hotay hain yaar Amir please ab haat halka rakhna aisa gana gana jo humain bhi samajh aye üòÇ
10/29/16, 11:18 AM - Mashood Yunus: asked girls to continue singing but not change lyrics to prasie him.  he reminded Abu Bakr that it is our Eid and it is ok to enjoy on eid]
10/29/16, 11:20 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood.. ok.. what does that show yoy?
10/29/16, 11:20 AM - Shakil Ahmed: you?
10/29/16, 11:20 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Should we not praise RasoolAllah in the best way we can? naoozubillah
10/29/16, 11:20 AM - Adnan Ali: Mashood then why is poetry at Dargah's and its part of Sufi culture as well not that I am Sufi
10/29/16, 11:21 AM - Amir A. Sattar: the best way is that enjoy life in a simple and beautifull way and think you believe in a God who is loving and forgiving
10/29/16, 11:21 AM - Mashood Yunus: Adnan - this is why Sufi and mainstream islam has differences
10/29/16, 11:21 AM - Shakil Ahmed: üëç
10/29/16, 11:22 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Amir... Allah tujhay rang lagaaye
10/29/16, 11:22 AM - Mashood Yunus: you might notice, I ignore such questions because music is smaller sin than aqeedah about Allah swt.  people focusing on Allah is where I leave them.  Allah will guide us all
10/29/16, 11:22 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar kya karoun kishore ka har gana hi bohat muskil hai
10/29/16, 11:23 AM - Mashood Yunus: but when we fall for arguments among us on smaller matters, we lose track of the real and bigger issue
10/29/16, 11:23 AM - Amir A. Sattar: thanx bro
10/29/16, 11:23 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Mashhood... exactly... Alhamdullillah we all are clear on Aqeedah about Allah azzawajal and His Beloved Muhammad SWAS
10/29/16, 11:24 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar main na to bohat zyada sakht houn aur na hi liberal bas har cheez ko balance main la kar chalta houn
10/29/16, 11:24 AM - Adnan Ali: Agree Amir balance
10/29/16, 11:24 AM - Amir A. Sattar: music is not a sin
10/29/16, 11:24 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes Shakil - i will not go into your question about praise for that reason.  Our talk started with Alcohol, we all agreed there alhamdulillah
10/29/16, 11:25 AM - Mashood Yunus: rest is upto you guys.  each one is responsible for their own learning and sharing :)  and I am for mine
10/29/16, 11:25 AM - Adnan Ali: Who doesn't agree on Alcohol ?
10/29/16, 11:25 AM - Amir A. Sattar: there had been and still is great debate going on between scholors about music üòÄüòÄ

10/29/16, 11:29 AM - Amir A. Sattar: actually

You know I want to mention here that her appearance, seems to me, is on purpose, she wants only people with vision to get the message of LOVE 
All Others get distracted by her vague looks and poor demeanour, simply get absorbed in it and never get the message

Sadly, Sociological Sympathetic Introspection is the fashion and considered the norm by society where the investigator imagines himself or herself engaged in that conduct.

Denial and Fear are two biggest hurdles to overcome the challenge of self introspection

THE FOUR WIVES

There was a man with four wives. He loved his fourth wife the most and took great care of her and gave her the best.

He also loved his third wife and always wanted to show her off to his friends. However, he always had a fear that she might runaway with some other man.

He loved his second wife too. Whenever he faced some problems, he always turned to his second wife and she would always help him out.

He did not love his first wife though she loved him deeply, was very loyal to him and took great care of him. 

One day the man fell very ill and knew that he is going to die soon. He told himself, *_"I have four wives. I will take one of them along with me when I die to keep me company in my death."_*

Thus, he asked the fourth wife to die along with him and keep him company. *_"No way!"_* she replied and walked away without another word.

He asked his third wife. She said *_"Life is so good over here. I'm going to remarry when you die"._*

He then asked his second wife. She said *_"I'm Sorry. I can't help you this time around. At the most I can only accompany you till your grave."_*

By now his heart sank and he turned cold. Then a voice called out: *_"I'll go with you. I'll follow you no matter where you go."_*

The man looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrition. Greatly grieved, the man said, *_"I should have taken much better care of you while I could have!"_*

Actually, we all have four wives in our lives.

a. *The fourth wife is our body.* No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good, it'll leave us when we die.

b. *The third wife is our possession, status and wealth.* When we die, they go to others.

c. *The second wife is our family and friends.* No matter how close they had been there for us when we're alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave.

d. *The first wife is our soul,* neglected in our pursuit of material wealth and pleasure. It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go.

11/8/16, 3:29 AM - Amer Aslam: Aslamu alaiqum. 

Aaj ka notice hai sub ko. 

K is group ki sari batein ya discussions sirf 6 categories may aati hein. 

1. Lerkiyan videos ya pics. 
2. Paisa ya jobs ya economy. 
3. Comedy video ya pics. 
4. Mazheb. 
5. Siaset. 

Aur 6 "fazool talk". 
E.g " so rha tha, bus may tha, truck may. Gari may hoon. Chand dekha, soorej dekha , serk may khada hai. "

Waghera waghera. 

Yeh saray topics insaan k liye zaroori hein including fazool talk. Kayee dafa insani nefsiyaat ko yaqeen manein k fazool talk ki zarooret hoti hai. 

Ab yeh hai k kuch log kisi topic may interested hein to kuch kisi may. 

Ager sub log sub ka khayal krein to group bend ho jaye ga kiyonkay phir aap baat hi nhin kr sakein gay, k kisi ko kuch chahiye to kisi ko kuch. 

Jub do teen topics khulay hein aur baqi do teen bend. To samejh nhin aata. 

Kiyinkay jo topics khulay hein un may say mujhay bhi kayee batein nhin achi lagteen. 

May sirf skip kr dayta hoon. 

Sub ko pata hai k skip kaisay krtay hein. 

Humein itna ab mature ho kr baat krni aur suneni chahiye na k meri suno bus , bachpun ki tera aur may nay kisi ki nhin suneni. 

Ager again koi 42 + ho kr bhi itna abhi mature nhin to straight up ......chahay woh koi bhi ho , usay yeh group chor dayna chahiye. 

Aik chotay say ghar may behn bhaion may aik baat nhin hoti to yeh to baba itna bera mulk hai aur dunya us say bhi beri hai. 

Plz kuch mature honay ka saboot dein nhin to adaleti karwayee ka notice bhaija jaye ga. 

Akhir may freedom of speech pay uncle google per thori c research kr lein. 

Again jo cheez nhin pasand us ko sirf skip kr dein usay zati apni fazool ki ana ka masla na banayein kiyonkay is dunya may beray beray badshahon k sath jo hoa woh aap ko thori deir may aik documentary dikhatay hein sirf knowledge k liye, baqi hum sub ki koi awqat nhin. 

Shukrya.

_Trump was baffled, so he e-mailed it to Vanessa Trump and his children. Vanessa Trump and the children had no clue either, so they sent it to the FBI. *No one could solve it at FBI, CIA or NASA.

11/9/16, 4:14 AM - Saif Azam: *Trump's first day at the Oval Office after being elected President.*

First briefing by the CIA, Pentagon, FBI:

Trump: We must destroy ISIS immediately. No delays.

CIA: We cannot do that, sir. We created them along with Turkey, Saudi, Qatar and others.

Trump: The Democrats created them.

CIA: We created ISIS, sir. You need them or else you would lose funding from the natural gas lobby.

Trump: Stop funding Pakistan. Let India deal with them.

CIA: We can't do that.

Trump: Why is that?

CIA: India will cut Balochistan out of Pak.

Trump: I don't care.

CIA: India will have peace in Kashmir. They will stop buying our weapons. They will become a superpower. We have to fund Pakistan to keep India busy in Kashmir.

Trump: But you have to destroy the Taliban.

CIA: Sir, we can't do that. We created the Taliban to keep Russia in check during the 80s. Now they are keeping Pakistan busy and away from their nukes.

Trump: We have to destroy terror sponsoring regimes in the Middle East. Let us start with the Saudis.

Pentagon: Sir, we can't do that. We created those regimes because we wanted their oil. We can't have democracy there, otherwise their people will get that oil - and we cannot let their people own it.

Trump: Then, let us invade Iran.

Pentagon: We cannot do that either, sir.

Trump: Why not?

CIA: We are talking to them, sir.

Trump: What? Why?

CIA: We want our Stealth Drones back. If we attack them, Russia will obliterate us as they did to our buddy ISIS in Syria. Besides we need Iran to keep Israel in check.

Trump: Then let us invade Iraq again.

CIA: Sir, our friends (ISIS) are already occupying 1/3rd of Iraq.

Trump: Why not the whole of Iraq?

CIA: We need the Shi'ite govt of Iraq to keep ISIS in check.

Trump: I am banning Muslims from entering US.

FBI: We can't do that.

Trump: Why not?

FBI: Then our own population will become fearless.

Trump: I am deporting all illegal immigrants to south of the border.

Border patrol: You can't do that, sir.

Trump: Why not?

Border patrol: If they're gone, who will build the wall?

Trump: I am banning H1B visas.

USCIS: You cannot do that.

Trump: Why?

Chief of Staff: If you do so, we'll have to outsource White House operations to Bangalore. Which is in India.

Trump (sweating profusely by now): What the hell should I do as President???

CIA: Enjoy the White House, sir! We will take care of the rest!

11/9/16, 11:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Bro he is the odd man for sure but we all know thar policies that a president needs ti comply with dont change much. The most serious matter with him winning is the social repercussions for minorities.
11/9/16, 11:24 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Killary was bad for the world but Muslims would have felt much at ease in the US.
11/9/16, 11:26 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: lets see if he can really show resistance to the puppet masters and escape the fate of jfk.

No one is doing a favour to Muslim Umma.
11/9/16, 11:43 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes ... Hehe. ... and even if they did it would be because of their own personal interests
11/9/16, 11:44 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Muslim leaders are doing no favors to Ummah either so we can't complain about others üòá
11/9/16, 11:48 AM - Abdul Hafeez: 100 % agree.
Muslim Leaders are the top most in my list.
11/9/16, 11:52 AM - Abdul Hafeez: So called leaders running... or shall I say exploiting the resources of nation for 4-6 decades are all to blame.
11/9/16, 12:03 PM - Faraz Kashif: The word *Muslim Ummah* although sounds comforting in  actuality is *non-existent*

We are Proud Muslims that are all segregated in different Muslim Nations
Zionists have sucdeeded long ago and will continue to make sure that these Muslim nations never turn into an UMMAH

Only the *Final IMAM* holds this Tasks Accomplishment 
No other leader has or will have Devine Help in this matter

World will not end untill every single thing our Beloved Prophet SAW said comes true

11/9/16, 3:34 PM - Faisal Farooqi: A lot of things he said to gather votes are going to be conveniently swept under the rug
11/9/16, 3:37 PM - Mashood Yunus: Yeah ...
11/9/16, 3:39 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i dont think so i think he meant every word of it
11/9/16, 3:41 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Well lets see... the problem is not him but rather the ignorants who take his boasts seriously and take matters into own hand

11/9/16, 5:20 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I am by no means forcing anyone to stop sharing what they feel is appropriate but unfortunately a stage will come when the receiving side will start making decisions on the acceptability of the shared material

Alhamdulillah,
Those who counted on Clinton, they now have Trump. Those who counted on Allah, they still have Allah. 
Those who will not focus now on building a sound infrastructure and thriving institutions for the Muslim community in America will bear the disgrace of inaction. 
Those who will continue the infighting and bickering that are fueled by feeble intellects, haughty egos, and ignorance (or the more dangerous limited knowledge) will deserve whatever punishment they may receive.

11/10/16, 7:46 AM - Ziad Asghar: Many do and it is indeed mistaken belief
11/10/16, 7:46 AM - Shakil Ahmed: that's our prejudice to think that way
11/10/16, 7:47 AM - Ziad Asghar: No, if a person bows towards a grave, is he worshiping it?
11/10/16, 7:48 AM - Ziad Asghar: Probably a discussion for the religious group.

11/10/16, 8:07 AM - Shakil Ahmed: ji bay shak... Allah hi ki ibaadat kartay hain mangtay bhi Allah say hain...
11/10/16, 8:09 AM - Shakil Ahmed: this is a typical judgment passed around so easily on Muslims by some fellow muslims.... shirk, biddat, kufr....
11/10/16, 8:10 AM - Ziad Asghar: Where is the judgement in that statement?  It comes directly from here: 
039:038 Khan	
:
And verily, if you ask them: "Who created the heavens and the earth?" Surely, they will say: "Allah (has created them)." Say: "Tell me then, the things that you invoke besides Allah, if Allah intended some harm for me, could they remove His harm, or if He (Allah) intended some mercy for me, could they withhold His Mercy?" Say: "Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him those who trust (i.e. believers) must put their trust."
11/10/16, 8:11 AM - Shakil Ahmed: not in that...
11/10/16, 8:12 AM - Shakil Ahmed: going to a teacher, a doctor,
11/10/16, 8:13 AM - Shakil Ahmed: I am saying that ... if we blame other muslims they are worshiping graves asking from deceased...   in that statent
11/10/16, 8:14 AM - Ziad Asghar: If they are asking from the deceased then it is a clear itiqaad problem and is a clear form of shirk.  I think we both agreed to that.
11/10/16, 8:15 AM - Ziad Asghar: There is no judgement, here it is a fact and we must advise those people since they may have been misguided by some so called religious people.
11/10/16, 8:19 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes it would be shirk.... if people did that....
11/10/16, 8:21 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes we should advise if we know their beliefs are against true Islam
11/10/16, 8:23 AM - Shakil Ahmed: there are very zealous religious preachers in all spectrums of interpretation.....

11/10/16, 10:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: And muslims should know better. Tawaaf vs grave worshipping of urs, mazaar and all what comes with them can never be compared.
11/10/16, 10:21 AM - Mashood Yunus: Such exercise s have never existed from the practices of our prophet and our sahabah. It s that simple and we as ummah of prophet pbuh have this responsibility of sharing tauheed until day of judgement as it is, not its modified versions, most of which land us in shirk, bid'aat and getting sidetracked from our main responsibilities (such as the discussions we are having). A muslim needs to be this clear about who and what he/she worships.
11/10/16, 10:24 AM - Nassar Nizami: Please take the religious conversation private
11/10/16, 10:25 AM - Nassar Nizami: We have people with variety of beliefs - let's respect all
11/10/16, 10:25 AM - Mashood Yunus: This is a discussion for all muslims, Ziad. Not just for me, you, shakil or amer.  And as I had posted earlier, all of us need to be that knowledgeable about our aqaaid. If we never learnt such practices from our prophet pbuh and sahabah, where did they creep in from?  Today one of us is defending sajdah to graves... What is next?
11/10/16, 10:27 AM - Mashood Yunus: Thanks for being so clear on this.
11/10/16, 10:27 AM - Nassar Nizami: I respectfully disagree
11/10/16, 10:27 AM - Nassar Nizami: Not everyone is a Muslim in this forum and we certainly don't share the same beliefs
11/10/16, 10:29 AM - Faraz Kashif: üëç
11/10/16, 10:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: Our aqeedah never consisted of such practices at all shakil. This is what islam had abolished. Kuffar of makkah said they found their parents doing these same things ... So the excuses made here are of similar nature. This is success of shaytaan that muslims supposed to be sharing tauheed are busy fighting, arguing and justifying their basic acts of worship wih each o her. May Allah swt save us all from such practices
11/10/16, 10:30 AM - Faraz Kashif: Yea have to be mindful of all here
11/10/16, 10:32 AM - Mashood Yunus: Very well said
11/10/16, 10:35 AM - Mashood Yunus: Thank u :)
11/10/16, 10:36 AM - Nassar Nizami: You cannot criticize and then blame shaitan for dividing us :)
11/10/16, 10:37 AM - Mashood Yunus: Absolutely can especially when Muslims themselves are becoming a party to him :)
11/10/16, 10:39 AM - Nassar Nizami: It's a good thing :)
11/10/16, 10:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: Absolutely can especially when Muslims themselves are becoming a party to him :)
11/10/16, 10:43 AM - Amir A. Sattar: the religion is the 5 pillars of islam nothing more nothing else

11/10/16, 10:50 AM - Mashood Yunus: Thx amir. I understand ali saying that he is being forced to be shut. We all know that people of other beliefs are here but that is not an excuse to stop speaking the truth. As nassar reminded it needs to be done in a respectful way but there is no respect for shaytan and his ways. We need to be at least that clear . No one among us respects shaytaan and so no one will be offended by pinpointing what shaytaans way of derailing tauheed are

Politics group exists. :) it also seems, it is not just one of us, most of us do not prefer to hqve another group otherwise it would have been made by now :) ... I am ok with it ... I am done saying what I wanted to say.
11/10/16, 10:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: Amir .. Now that is bollywood way of believing :)
11/10/16, 10:57 AM - Amir A. Sattar: this is some thing new it looks like u r quite impressed with boly wood
11/10/16, 10:58 AM - Mashood Yunus: Hehehe ... Ganday kaheen kay ...
11/10/16, 10:59 AM - Mashood Yunus: I guess lolywood believes in same because we all have been posting "dosti aisa naata" kind of stuff

11/11/16, 9:40 AM - Amir A. Sattar: what a b___________h
11/11/16, 9:41 AM - Mashood Yunus: Br amir. She has been out there since PMU. While she has some valid issues, her solutions are quite sad. She claims to be from maulana shibli nomanis relative
11/11/16, 9:42 AM - Amir A. Sattar: Amir aslam aur Mashoud jan sa guzarish hai ka please rabta karain
11/11/16, 9:42 AM - Mashood Yunus: It is best to ignore her ... She and her group was behind amina wudood leading the friday prayer in year 2003 , if I remember correctly
11/11/16, 9:42 AM - Amir A. Sattar: aap logoun ki reform ki bohat zarorat hai
11/11/16, 9:42 AM - Mashood Yunus: Ho gaya rabitah ... Hehe
11/11/16, 9:43 AM - Amir A. Sattar: <Media omitted>
11/11/16, 9:43 AM - Amir A. Sattar: hahahahaha
11/11/16, 9:43 AM - Mashood Yunus: Mujhay tau aap transform, reform, confirm, abform, misform, sab he ker lo yaar. Bus jannat mil jaye baaqi koi parwa nahee
11/11/16, 9:46 AM - Amir A. Sattar: jannat ki guranti hai bro
11/11/16, 9:46 AM - Amir A. Sattar: woh to zarour mila gi inshallah
11/11/16, 9:59 AM - Mashood Yunus: Guarantee koi nahee. It is all by mercy of Allah :) let us not over simplify it
11/11/16, 10:00 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yar yahi to bat hai jo loug samajhta nahi hain
11/11/16, 10:00 AM - Mashood Yunus: üôÇ
11/11/16, 10:00 AM - Amir A. Sattar: gurantee hai bhai nabi na khud di hai
11/11/16, 10:03 AM - Amir A. Sattar: hadeeth that was narrated by Muslim in his¬†Saheeh¬†(135) from Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the two deeds that make entering Paradise or Hell inevitable?

He said: ‚ÄúWhoever dies not associating anything with Allah will enter Paradise, and whoever dies associating anything with Allah will enter Hell
11/11/16, 10:05 AM - Amir A. Sattar: simple u ses
11/11/16, 10:07 AM - Amir A. Sattar: see
11/11/16, 10:09 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Agree. Even though we say the kalima and witnesd the oneness of His Almighty...
Most of the muslims do associate many others with Him.... knowingly and unknowingly...
11/11/16, 10:11 AM - Abdul Hafeez: There is a very very fine line between Al-Tauheed and shirk...
11/11/16, 10:12 AM - Abdul Hafeez: We need to do lot of research to distinguish it.
11/11/16, 10:14 AM - Mashood Yunus: Thx br amir and abdul hafeez. Inshallah we will strive hard to not fall into shirk so we do not associate anyone with Allah and be ready for mercy of Allah on day of judgement. We will do our work together inshallah
11/11/16, 10:14 AM - Amir A. Sattar: who does that will lose every thing
11/11/16, 10:15 AM - Abdul Hafeez: A very small example is ...
Wearing a ring...
Now there is no harm in wearing a ring... but ask majority of the people and they say...
This will cure me of my evil-eye... or my wellbeing or will bring goodluck...
11/11/16, 10:17 AM - Amir A. Sattar: this is not minor example or a simple one my friend if u do that u are in a big trouble
11/11/16, 10:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: Excellent example, alhamdulillah
11/11/16, 10:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: We all agree. Sadly many muslims have fallen for such things
11/11/16, 10:18 AM - Amir A. Sattar: they are in fault
11/11/16, 10:18 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Agree.. wearing a ring is a very minor day to day activity... but let ask my brother to throw it away for the sake of Allah...
You might be surprised to see the response! !
11/11/16, 10:19 AM - Amir A. Sattar: wearing a ring is not bad but having certain belives with it is some thing else
11/11/16, 10:20 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Aray eating Chicken biryani is not haram but....
Wishing something on 'Wish Bone' is...
11/11/16, 10:21 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Now Im getting hungry... he he
11/11/16, 10:21 AM - Saifullah Inayat: <Media omitted>
11/11/16, 10:22 AM - Mashood Yunus: Alhamdulillah, very true br amir and br abdul hafeez. Inshallah all will realize these shortcomings in aqeedah so we can all defeat shaytaan. His main goal is to get us into shirk so.we.can not share the true message of One God with humanity
11/11/16, 10:22 AM - Mashood Yunus: And me too. I should eat something
11/11/16, 10:22 AM - Amir A. Sattar: shirk is the biggest sin
11/11/16, 10:22 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Assalaamualaikum all
11/11/16, 10:22 AM - Abdul Hafeez: ÿ¨ÿ≤ÿßŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿÆŸäÿ±ÿß  Bro

11/11/16, 10:23 AM - Mashood Yunus: Alhamdulillah
11/11/16, 10:24 AM - Amir A. Sattar: we should try to abstain from it and pray to Allah almighty he helps us to achieve that
11/11/16, 10:24 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Abdul Hafeez Balouch
11/11/16, 10:24 AM - Ziad Asghar: Great, how are you AB?
11/11/16, 10:24 AM - Shakil Ahmed: there is something required of us for our brothers
11/11/16, 10:24 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Admin not making use of contact sheet üò•

11/11/16, 10:25 AM - Ziad Asghar: You want me to do that much work. :)
11/11/16, 10:25 AM - Ziad Asghar: Yes, Alhamdolillah.  Still here.  Leaving tomorrow inshaAllah.
11/11/16, 10:25 AM - Amir A. Sattar: mashoud here i think Allahs  mercy play a big role to which prophet refered in his hadith
11/11/16, 10:25 AM - Abdul Hafeez: He he.. sorry my mistake...
11/11/16, 10:26 AM - Ziad Asghar: No problem.  I will call you ab from now one.
11/11/16, 10:26 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Ziad when was your last visit in ISB?
11/11/16, 10:26 AM - Mashood Yunus: Yes br amir. his shafaa'ah inshallah like all prophets will be looking for
11/11/16, 10:26 AM - Ziad Asghar: In February.  I usually try to come once or twice a year since parents are here now.
11/11/16, 10:27 AM - Abdul Hafeez: ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØŸÑŸÑŸá  my regards to your parents
11/11/16, 10:27 AM - Ziad Asghar: Jzk bro..
11/11/16, 10:27 AM - Mashood Yunus: Alhamdulillah, great reminder by abdul hafeez. Please say my salam to your parents too, ziad
11/11/16, 10:28 AM - Ziad Asghar: Will do inshaAllah.
11/11/16, 10:28 AM - Waseem Choudry: Aoa to all amir can you call me on imo
11/11/16, 10:28 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Mashoud Bro... I havent forgotten my promise.. but I will call soon..
11/11/16, 10:30 AM - Shakil Ahmed: ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ ÿ∏ŸÜ
11/11/16, 10:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: No problem abdul hafiz
11/11/16, 10:30 AM - Abdul Hafeez: One Q... do arabic typing is readable to all ?
11/11/16, 10:30 AM - Mashood Yunus: I can read it fine
11/11/16, 10:31 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Husn-e-Zann (which is a desired quality as mentioned in the Hadith: ÿ∏ŸÜŸàÿß ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ§ŸÖŸÜŸäŸÜ ÿÆŸäÿ±ÿß [Entertain good thoughts about believers.]) requires no proof. Not having any proof for soo-e-zann (evil thoughts) (which is abhorred and prohibited by Allah Ta`ala in the Qur‚Äôaan: Ÿäÿß ÿ£ŸäŸáÿß ÿßŸÑÿ∞ŸäŸÜ ÿ£ŸÖŸÜŸàÿß ÿßÿ¨ÿ™ŸÜÿ®Ÿàÿß ŸÉÿ´Ÿäÿ±ÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ∏ŸÜ (O you who believe! Abstain from suspicions.) [12:49]) and a person merely being a Muslim are sufficient for entertaining good thoughts for a person. However, one requires proof to have evil thoughts for the next person.
(It is sinful to entertain evil thoughts regarding someone without any reliable proof. Allah Ta`ala states: ÿ•ŸÜŸë ÿ®ÿπÿ∂ ÿßŸÑÿ∏ŸÜŸë ÿ•ÿ´ŸÖ [Some thoughts are sinful.])
11/11/16, 10:31 AM - Mashood Yunus: Waalikum assalam wasim
11/11/16, 10:31 AM - Abdul Hafeez: ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØŸÑŸÑŸá ... I was worried a bit
11/11/16, 10:31 AM - Waseem Choudry: H r u all my bros
11/11/16, 10:32 AM - Ziad Asghar: <Media omitted>
11/11/16, 10:32 AM - Ziad Asghar: üòä
11/11/16, 10:33 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Brother Shakil... I agree about ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ∏ŸÜ 
Any there is  a hadeeth to give 70 excuses for brother  Muslim....
11/11/16, 10:34 AM - Abdul Hafeez: But I have direct conversation with people and they reply...
Falan Maulvi nay diya tha ya kisi nay recommend kiya hay
11/11/16, 10:37 AM - Abdul Hafeez: Really amazing... been bitting fingers for last 8 year... waiting for this day..
11/11/16, 10:38 AM - Mashood Yunus: Hehe
11/11/16, 10:39 AM - Abdul Hafeez: I will catch up you guys... later... Allah ma'kum.
11/11/16, 10:40 AM - Mashood Yunus: Wa iyaakum brother.  Thx

11/11/16, 10:42 AM - Amir A. Sattar: yes
11/11/16, 10:42 AM - Amir A. Sattar: all
11/11/16, 10:42 AM - Amir A. Sattar: only wassupp works
11/11/16, 10:42 AM - Waseem Choudry: I will msg on whattsapp
11/11/16, 10:56 AM - Shakil Ahmed: so do they tell you that .. shirk karnay kay liye ring pehni hai?
11/11/16, 10:57 AM - Shakil Ahmed: if someone recommends me to drink tea at night to deal with headache.... is that shirk?
11/11/16, 10:59 AM - Amir A. Sattar: no its not bro obviously
11/11/16, 10:59 AM - Shakil Ahmed: wearing ring is sunnah as well
11/11/16, 11:00 AM - Shakil Ahmed: If I ask someone to throw their watch for the sake of Allah...   and they don't... are they mushrik?
11/11/16, 11:00 AM - Amir A. Sattar: hahaha
11/11/16, 11:02 AM - Amir A. Sattar: u should understand that things are not at fault but the belives which people associate with these things are
11/11/16, 11:03 AM - Shakil Ahmed: exactly.... and beliefs are in their heart... and hearts conditions are known by Allah.... we shouldn't judge
11/11/16, 11:04 AM - Shakil Ahmed: otherwise... all chicken biryani eaters could be mushrik
11/11/16, 11:05 AM - Amir A. Sattar: some time beliefs are also shown through actions
11/11/16, 11:06 AM - Amir A. Sattar: its important to match your actions with your believes
11/11/16, 11:17 AM - Mashood Yunus: Thx for explaining it well br amir. Expecting a ring to save from evil is a very clear shirk vs. Taking medication to cure headache. They cannot be compared.
11/11/16, 11:22 AM - Amir A. Sattar: shirq is about the beliefs not the thingsüòÉüòÉ
11/11/16, 11:36 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Soo az Zan brings judgment. Thats why forbidden. Again the trigger "takfeer" happy gang loves it. In Pakistan people  (including children) are being sentenced to death. Stop the madness!!!!
11/11/16, 11:39 AM - Faraz Kashif: Amen brother
11/11/16, 11:41 AM - Shakil Ahmed: lol... like eating biryani?
11/11/16, 11:42 AM - Shakil Ahmed: we can't dump hindu beliefs on Muslims
11/11/16, 11:43 AM - Shakil Ahmed: of course, expecting a ring to save from evil is shirk.....
11/11/16, 11:43 AM - Mashood Yunus: Ameen aqeel
11/11/16, 11:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: We are not shakil. Those muslims who themselves claim that they expect the ring to save themselves from evil or similar claims are subject of our discussion here
11/11/16, 11:53 AM - Shakil Ahmed: I haven't met anyone who calls himself a Muslim and claim exactly that....
11/11/16, 11:54 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: We live in an age where the self righteous gang has gone so extreme that they regularly violate the principle of Husn az Zan
11/11/16, 11:54 AM - Faraz Kashif: Ring was brought about as a subjective dicusssion rather than Objective 

If we wanna discuss of a RING as an Object than no better RING to discuss that ruled them all and served many purposes 
The RING of all rings that served ONLY ONE MASTER 
Such a powerful ring that couldn't bear another keeper 
So Allah made it easy for humanity and made it disappear
11/11/16, 11:54 AM - Shakil Ahmed: i have heard people wearing ring for Sunnah... health and positive energy
11/11/16, 11:55 AM - Faraz Kashif: Because it is worn as a Sunnah 
Yes it will do all that
11/11/16, 11:55 AM - Mashood Yunus: Great if u have not met anyone like that.
11/11/16, 11:56 AM - Faraz Kashif: Every single Sunnah bears ultimate powers
11/11/16, 11:56 AM - Shakil Ahmed: have you?
11/11/16, 11:56 AM - Mashood Yunus: Many ...
11/11/16, 11:57 AM - Faraz Kashif: I can bet most of them if all carry a portable TARAZOO in their top front pocket
11/11/16, 11:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Imagine Rasulullah SAW dishing out judgement left and right like the self righteous gang
11/11/16, 11:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Maaz Allah
11/11/16, 11:58 AM - Shakil Ahmed: how many? what did they say?
11/11/16, 11:59 AM - Mashood Yunus: Do not go in circles :)
11/11/16, 12:00 PM - Mashood Yunus: I told u what they said
11/11/16, 12:01 PM - Shakil Ahmed: did you tell them they are committing shirk?
11/11/16, 12:02 PM - Mashood Yunus: Yes
11/11/16, 12:02 PM - Shakil Ahmed: did they stop?
11/11/16, 12:02 PM - Shakil Ahmed: stop believing?
11/11/16, 12:03 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: <Media omitted>
11/11/16, 12:03 PM - Mashood Yunus: Nope
11/11/16, 12:04 PM - Shakil Ahmed: http://www.thenewsteller.com/world/pakistani-news-channel-claims-donald-trump-was-born-in-pakistan-video/39161/
11/11/16, 12:04 PM - Shakil Ahmed: trump was born in Pakistan........ news
11/11/16, 12:05 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yeah this and that simspon clips even duped mainstream media
11/11/16, 12:07 PM - Shakil Ahmed: so.. was he mushrik before you telling him or after?
11/11/16, 12:09 PM - Mashood Yunus: Shakil ... I think it is very clear what we are talking here
11/11/16, 12:10 PM - Shakil Ahmed: it is not Mashhood
11/11/16, 12:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood what Shakil and myself are pointing out at is that the takfeeri machine gun put aside and empathy used instead
11/11/16, 12:10 PM - Shakil Ahmed: if he is a mushrik before u told him, then you were not talking to a muslim
11/11/16, 12:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: thats the Sunnah way
11/11/16, 12:11 PM - Faraz Kashif: *POINT*
Was waiting for it to emerge
11/11/16, 12:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: very good point
11/11/16, 12:14 PM - Amir A. Sattar: correction its going to do nothing
11/11/16, 12:16 PM - Amir A. Sattar: the only thing ring is going to do is show you are married , so beautifull girls no no üòÇüòÇüòÇ
11/11/16, 12:16 PM - Mashood Yunus: Aqeel. That point is not valid here. We are strictly talking about how widespread shirk is such as associating divine powers to a ring and other objects. If we agree on this, good. Rest of the talk is useless
11/11/16, 12:17 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mashhood it is very valid since this same nentality us being taken to extremes in Pakistan resulting in death sentences ti even children
11/11/16, 12:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Thus needs to be nipped in the bud
11/11/16, 12:18 PM - Faraz Kashif: Correction 
When ring worn as a sunnah than its not ring its Sunnah
11/11/16, 12:18 PM - Mashood Yunus: I am not talking about what some people are doing. I am talking about what is clear in islam
11/11/16, 12:19 PM - Amir A. Sattar: for that you will have to know the reason behind the sunnah
11/11/16, 12:20 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: <Media omitted>
11/11/16, 12:20 PM - Amir A. Sattar: the ring was only used as a stamp ,not for gaining energy or any thing else
11/11/16, 12:20 PM - Shakil Ahmed: for Sunnah.... reasoning is not required.... it's the belief
11/11/16, 12:21 PM - Shakil Ahmed: yes.... true

11/12/16, 7:24 AM - Shakil Ahmed: my daughter's school sent an email after Trump to parents... I thought that was good... let me share it here
11/12/16, 7:28 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Assalamualiekum warehmatullahi wabaraktuh,
I hope this email reaches everyone in the best of health. This has been a very long and exhausting political year for all of us. Unfortunately, our children have been exposed to racism and hatred through social media, television, radio and the internet. Adults have been discussing the political campaign and which candidate is best for our community for almost a year now. Many of us and our children have been anxious and disappointed with the outcome of the election. We need to assure our children that Allah SWT has power over all things and is the best Protector. 
We spoke to the students on Tuesday after salah and on Wednesday after the morning halaqa about the election and how we should be strong and confident in Allah's protection and continue being the best examples of character and continue contributing positively to the community as much as possible.
Here are few suggestions for you as parents to help support your children:
1) Come to terms with your own feelings about the political climate. Renew your faith  in Allah (SWT) and your confidence that He is the Best Protector. Children will know how you feel in spite of what you say and when you are anxious, they will be also.
2) Constantly remind them that Allah is protecting us and that we should always remember to make dua for peace and safety for all people.
3) Please explain to them that people had many reasons for voting for Trump and that they don't necessarily agree with the negative comments he has made about Muslims and Islam.
4) Please remind themthat we should focus on being good and helping others as Islam teaches.
5) Please remind them to exhibit proper Islamic manners within the house and in public places.
6) Please remind them to be watchful of their surroundings also at the same time assure them that they are still well received in the community.
7) Please caution them to be careful with their words on text messages and social media.
8) Parents, please be careful what you say in front of your children. Alhumdulilah our children are very intelligent and observe us very closely.  
9) If you or your children experience any bullying, intimidation, threat or disrespect in the community please document the incident and report it to the police and CAIR.  Take pictures of the people involved it is safe to do so, and make a note of license plate numbers if possible. Discrimination and harassment is illegal and will only stop when people are held accountable for their behavior.
10) Please constantly remind your children that MUA teachers and adminstrators are here to help them, listen to them and they can openly discuss whatever is on their mind.
JazaakAllah khair,
Sr Saima

11/12/16, 10:05 PM - Asif Iqbal: Denmark wants to Burn the Holy Quran on next Saturday in the large grounds in Copenhagen (capital city of Denmark ), in reply to the Islamic Boycott on their products. Please let's get together to boycott their products, and pray to Allah Almighty to show them the result of their intentions, which will be a lesson for the whole world. Forward this to as many friends as you can. Denmark is loosing, please don't let this msg stop.
Hope you all know about the Denmark newspaper which made fun of our beloved Holy Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and till now they do not regret. Let us make them regret for good. The Danish Ambassador, Prime Minister and Denmark National Channel, all are trying to do something just to stop the boycott by Muslims since last month through which their losses have reached 4 billion Euros. If we continue to boycott Denmark products 7 months more it could reach around 80 billion Euros loss. Believers do not let this message stop. Please forward this text to as many Muslims as possible. Can't u spare 15 minutes in order to spread this message among Muslims? REMEMBER THE PROPHET Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam MIGHT ASK YOU ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT, ‚ÄúWHAT DID YOU DO WHEN THEY MADE FUN OF ME‚Äù? "HOW DID YOU DEFEND ME‚Äù? Any products with barcode no. starting with 57 are Danish made Products. Please cause all Muslims to circulate this to the Ummah and to ban Danish made products

11/13/16, 10:09 AM - Faraz Kashif: Perhaps could be due to a simple fact that Chocolate is scientifically proven to raise Happy Hormone in the Brain *DOPAMINE*

Mutiple studies have been conducted to prove the effects of DOPAMINE in humans

Exercise raise Dopamine levels as well
11/13/16, 10:11 AM - Faraz Kashif: Than there are other ways to raise DOP level that are mostly frowned up and forbidden methods

11/13/16, 3:40 PM - Faisal Farooqi: That depends on visa
11/13/16, 3:42 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I am in for Toronto as long it is early August, kids school start Aug 14th
11/13/16, 3:43 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I just noticed that Imran Farhat left.... no clue what happened. He was not active last few days
11/13/16, 3:45 PM - Amir A. Sattar: a lot off people including me are uppset by the comments posted by some of the friends
11/13/16, 3:46 PM - Amir A. Sattar: its quite dissturbing üò°
11/13/16, 3:54 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Well a few days ago I had suggested that we avoid a topic when one of us objects to it
11/13/16, 3:56 PM - Faisal Farooqi: But at that time the response was that is a personal/private forum of adults and friends and we should be able to say anything
11/13/16, 3:57 PM - Faisal Farooqi: However Imran might just be changing numbers....
11/13/16, 3:57 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Lets wait for him
11/13/16, 3:57 PM - Amir A. Sattar: this dosent mean that people say things which they keep saying time and time again
11/13/16, 3:58 PM - Amir A. Sattar: seriously i am also thinking of leaving same as other people are
11/13/16, 3:59 PM - Faraz Kashif: Don't get jittery on us bro

Saying will leave cause others are leaving üòÇüòÇ
11/13/16, 4:00 PM - Amir A. Sattar: seriously i had a chat of the group with some of the friends and they have shown the same concern
11/13/16, 4:02 PM - Amir A. Sattar: these statements about relegion and politics are getting quite heavy on us
11/13/16, 4:02 PM - Faisal Farooqi: When Ziad and I set up the group our aim was to bring everyone together and not to cause additional friction
11/13/16, 4:03 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i hope this group is not meant to disscuss all these things rather as u said its to bring us friends close and in contact
11/13/16, 4:04 PM - Amir A. Sattar: but i am realy sorry how is at all going
11/13/16, 4:04 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I hope everyone here will continue to respect each other and avoid topics of contention
11/13/16, 4:05 PM - Amir A. Sattar: clearely some are not
11/13/16, 4:07 PM - Faisal Farooqi: That said respect is a two way street, if we get offended by statements made by others let's also try to keep our own words in check
11/13/16, 4:07 PM - Shakil Ahmed: agreed... all should respect and refrain from dividing posts and comments.......
11/13/16, 4:08 PM - Faraz Kashif: Imran had mentioned he was getting exhausted due to time consumption by our chats and not being able to fullfill all that needs to be done 

Will talk to him tomorrow inshallah 
Every single one in the group is important including their families.
Cant loose anyone 

Dont have words to explain how I felt for 2 straight days when i found out Adnan Sarwar died of LUPUS disease. He was very close to me. 

Life is too short and soon it will be over.
11/13/16, 4:09 PM - Faraz Kashif: Have to admit that group is addictive and time consuming and we are not teenagers any more tapping away on androids üòÅ

I was exhausted also 2 weeks ago than started alloting specific time of the day to it
Few others mentioned they are doing the same 

Naveed does a Surgical Strike Style entry exit deal üòä. 
Greetings, comments, concerns, wishes and Prayers. 
DONE

IN & OUT just like that 

I like it that way
11/13/16, 4:10 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i met adnan sarwar before a short time of his death , he was a good person
11/13/16, 4:10 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Well it is good that we are discussing this instead of harboring negative thoughts
11/13/16, 4:11 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Let us all maintain discipline for the sanity of all of us
11/13/16, 4:11 PM - Shakil Ahmed: very well said.... we are all adults... we should be tolerant respectful and understanding, and patient toward thoughts and ideas where we fully do not agree with and there are attiquets of being different..... we should take this opportunity to understand each others perspective
11/13/16, 4:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: etiquettes of addressing ppl is important no matter how much we disagree
11/13/16, 4:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: it tells a lot about how much we have grown since 91
11/13/16, 4:13 PM - Amir A. Sattar: please no politics or relegion or dogmatry coments .period .......
11/13/16, 4:13 PM - Faisal Farooqi: In my personal opinion 4 topics have been repeatedly mentioned to be avoided
1. Religion 
2. Politics 
3. Negative comments about anything
4. R rated material
11/13/16, 4:15 PM - Amir A. Sattar: common yar no body is going to post r rated material
11/13/16, 4:16 PM - Faisal Farooqi: We should all avoid these, do not respond if someone brings them up and politely ask them to stop
11/13/16, 4:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Name calling Also Faisal
11/13/16, 4:16 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Amir, I am sorry but you posted couple days back üòÄ
11/13/16, 4:16 PM - Faraz Kashif: Very nice indeed 
We slept in same bed when we were kids doing homework and play all night, sleep over concept  

I liked his moms Qeema Sandwiches that she used to make for him. He was fed up so he would let me take them and I would enjoy the heck out of them 

So many memories with him and he is not here to share with us 
HE WAS A GUY OUR AGE 

*GONE NOW* NEVER TO RETURN

Need to settle our differences in a polite way and give each other room to breathe
11/13/16, 4:16 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Agreed. We have passed our prime youth and shod be able 2 b a little mature now.. If anyone doesnt agree with anything,, he should tell it out LOUD, or have a healthy discussion... otherwise, life is too short to be bickering over trivial issues.. and WE are NOT that old to be quarreling like old women... so lets just enjoy the moments we have in life and CHILL....
11/13/16, 4:17 PM - Faraz Kashif: üòòüòò
11/13/16, 4:17 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

11/13/16, 4:18 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Yes I did not mean xxx üòé
11/13/16, 4:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: our words tell a lot about our maturity
11/13/16, 4:18 PM - Amir A. Sattar: trying to act like an angel are we ?
11/13/16, 4:19 PM - Amir A. Sattar: yes bro so true
11/13/16, 4:19 PM - Haroon Yousuf: R rated can be sent to Faisal personally....not in the group..
11/13/16, 4:20 PM - Amir A. Sattar: yar are lollywood movies are more R rated than that üòÇüòÇ
11/13/16, 4:20 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Well here is what we said about two way street. If you continue to post such pictures after objection will others take your objection to politics seriously?
11/13/16, 4:20 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: good point
11/13/16, 4:21 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: no one can dictate here we are all independent ppl
11/13/16, 4:21 PM - Amer Aslam: <Media omitted>
11/13/16, 4:21 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Haroon at his mischievous best üòá
11/13/16, 4:21 PM - Faraz Kashif: I will pull Imran Farhat's ears out 

Commotion caused over his exit üòä
11/13/16, 4:21 PM - Amir A. Sattar: why i feel as if u guyz are trying to drag things out of main topic
11/13/16, 4:22 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: He is cool
11/13/16, 4:22 PM - Haroon Yousuf: but i think A, Aslam shod be given the chance to expand his news channels to other countries as well....
11/13/16, 4:23 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yup super cool 
Just give him a break to sort things  out 
He will join us soon inshallah 
Groups addiction is unmatched
11/13/16, 4:23 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Mature wise man indeed
11/13/16, 4:23 PM - Amir A. Sattar: for me R rated is better than being happy at innocent people losing their life and calling them jhanami
11/13/16, 4:24 PM - Amir A. Sattar: and i am more sorry that their are people here who also share this thaught
11/13/16, 4:24 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Amir Aslam, yaar give us a few mins to sort things out before posting news üòÄ
11/13/16, 4:25 PM - Faraz Kashif: Amir Aslam is saying change topic nahi to bar bar aik he cheez post karoon ga üòÇ
11/13/16, 4:25 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: had a chat with him last night he needs a break
11/13/16, 4:25 PM - Amer Aslam: Abay khabrein chel rehi hein. 

Bolna mana hai.
11/13/16, 4:26 PM - Amer Aslam: Sirf 1 min.
11/13/16, 4:27 PM - Amer Aslam: Aray yaar mujhay nhin pata tha. 

Abhi utha hoon. Sunday. Hai.
11/13/16, 4:27 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I don't think anyone was condemning the innocent people who lost their lives. If you are referring to Aqeel's statement he was trying to explain the thinking of people who commit such horrendous acts
11/13/16, 4:28 PM - Amer Aslam: Sehih fermaya
11/13/16, 4:28 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: *Shake my damn head*
11/13/16, 4:28 PM - Faraz Kashif: Yaar Amir 
Aqeel mentioned that comment with utter sarcasm from a third persons perespctive  (the khabees suicidal's) who think they are only  jannati and other innocents that died are Jahanami 

He was condoning the suicide bombers bro
I hope i have cleared it for you 
He said it from that angle
11/13/16, 4:28 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Aqeel was being sarcastic
11/13/16, 4:29 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faraz check ur msg box
11/13/16, 4:29 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i find this quite dissgusting
11/13/16, 4:29 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÑ
11/13/16, 4:30 PM - Amir A. Sattar: every body in there sensible mind knows what this means üò°
11/13/16, 4:30 PM - Amer Aslam: Faisal yaar apna private message to check kr.
11/13/16, 4:30 PM - Haroon Yousuf: this was supposedly the view point of the suicide bomber.. thats what Aqeel was saying..
11/13/16, 4:30 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: ok I have meetings brossessess
11/13/16, 4:30 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: will come back later
11/13/16, 4:30 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: salam
11/13/16, 4:31 PM - Nassar Nizami: I say again - let's refrain from religion and politics
11/13/16, 4:31 PM - Faisal Farooqi: The sad reality is that this is the thinking of people who commit such acts and take lives of innocent people. Aqeel was pointing that out.
11/13/16, 4:31 PM - Amir A. Sattar: strange haroon and faisal this is ok with u guyzüò≥
11/13/16, 4:32 PM - Nassar Nizami: There are many other things to discuss - sports, career, education, family
11/13/16, 4:32 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Actually all topics r ok as long as we r mature enough to understand the other's view point....
11/13/16, 4:32 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Killing innocents is not ok with me, I am just trying to explain that was sarcastic but you refuse to understand
11/13/16, 4:32 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i have known both of you since school through college what have changed u guyz that much ?
11/13/16, 4:33 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i always try to put things in their context
11/13/16, 4:34 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Anyways I repeat what I said earlier, there is no moderator in this group..... we are all collective moderators
11/13/16, 4:35 PM - Faisal Farooqi: So lets all help out to keep things in check
11/13/16, 4:36 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Don't respond to topics of contention and if you feel offended ask to stop sharing or discussing further
11/13/16, 4:37 PM - Amir A. Sattar: it is too obvious for a 6 year old to understand but if u guyz refuse to do so i dont have any things to say
11/13/16, 4:38 PM - Amir A. Sattar: i am not like that you bet i am going to respond and respond i will üòâ
11/13/16, 4:38 PM - Amer Aslam: Yaar Nasar sawal mashreq jawab Maghreb murra. 

Yahan baat kuch aur ho rehi aur yaar tu kehin aur phoncha hoa hai. 

Bhai baat explicit pics aur dheshetgerdi ki ho rehi hai meri jaan aur ban yaar religious aur political baaton ko kiya ja rha hai.
11/13/16, 4:39 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Amer Aslam, religion and politics was also asked to be removed a few posts before you came in
11/13/16, 4:40 PM - Haroon Yousuf: Actualy Amir is a very very sensitive person.. and he doesnt want any sarcasim  either on such a sensitive topic.. we understand Amir. and respect your feelings...and we are on the same page with you in this regard bro.
11/13/16, 4:41 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I am however not going to explain any further, just consider that everyone else in the group understands what Aqeel said.... it is possible that you misunderstood it
11/13/16, 4:41 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I agree with this....
11/13/16, 4:42 PM - Nassar Nizami: I agree about pics too brother
11/13/16, 4:42 PM - Faraz Kashif: I understand your side too Amir
11/13/16, 4:44 PM - Nassar Nizami: The point is to stay away from controversies
11/13/16, 4:45 PM - Amir A. Sattar: listen guyz i am not saying that i am a pious person or even near it for that matter what i am saying is that we sholud not post this kinds of comments
11/13/16, 4:47 PM - Haroon Yousuf: yeah Amir Baloch. u are right... We totally agree with you. violence in any and every form should not be encouraged..
11/13/16, 4:47 PM - Amer Aslam: Yaar Nasar sawal mashreq jawab Maghreb. 

Abay controversies to apnay ghar may bhen bhaion say bhi hoti hein to kiya un ko bhi zindagi say duur kr dein. 

Yaara yeh tereeqa nhin hota. 

Masael ko suljahaya jata hai mazeed duur krnay say ulejhtay hein. 

Tujhay sir Raza k pass dobara theorems aur logic seekhnay jana peray ga thakur.
11/13/16, 4:48 PM - Amer Aslam: Amir tension not. 

Yahan sirf Aqeel nay tunz kiya tha. 

Koi bhi yahan violence aur dheshetgerdon k sath nhin. 

Koi bhi nhin.
11/13/16, 4:51 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I sound like a broken record, keep away from religion, politics, negativity and adult material and we should be good
11/13/16, 4:52 PM - Amir A. Sattar: bro we have to respect life and  also teach our childrens to do so thats the true spirit in which i believe
11/13/16, 4:52 PM - Nassar Nizami: Jawab Magrib nahin Hai. I believe Aqeel was being sarcastic but his sarcasm was about religious beliefs of he people who blow themselves - all I am suggesting is that let's not discuss religion and politics, even when being sarcastic
11/13/16, 4:53 PM - Faraz Kashif: After what i gathering
Sarcasm should be included in the list also since it can become challenging to fathom
11/13/16, 4:53 PM - Haroon Yousuf: well there IS a loophole...Even if we dont DISCUSS , we can INFORM???????
11/13/16, 4:53 PM - Amer Aslam: No no no. Sir raza k pass Jana peray ga. Lazmi ho gaya hai bhai.
11/13/16, 4:55 PM - Haroon Yousuf: like prob NO ONE discusses politics with Amir Aslam, but he can still keep us updated about the latest in at least 2 continents?????ü§îü§îü§î

11/13/16, 4:56 PM - Nassar Nizami: Good news
11/13/16, 4:56 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I have an alternate suggestion which we can test for a few days.....
Let's limit conversations to school, teachers, memories, trips, current life status etc basically something to do with us directly
11/13/16, 4:57 PM - Faisal Farooqi: For example, fishing trips, hunting, hiking, cooking
11/13/16, 4:57 PM - Nassar Nizami: I like the idea :)
11/13/16, 4:58 PM - Faisal Farooqi: News can be shared but not discussed
11/13/16, 4:58 PM - Nassar Nizami: I don't have any plans for thanks giving weekend. All are welcome to visit New York :)
11/13/16, 4:59 PM - Haroon Yousuf: thats good enough.... esp for our media bureau chiefüòú
11/13/16, 5:01 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Trying to accomodate everyone.... üòÇ

11/13/16, 5:14 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Amer, I agree with most of your suggestions but discussion on certain topics can lead to resentment with other members who are not participating
11/13/16, 5:17 PM - Amir A. Sattar: we should tell each other when and where we are wroung as you told me when i posted mrs trump pic

11/14/16, 12:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Comparison lead to Hasad
11/14/16, 12:39 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Comparison led to Hasad
11/14/16, 12:40 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: And where is fear in this?
11/14/16, 12:40 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Fear of Hijr....Giving someone better status than oneself
11/14/16, 12:41 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: this Fear leads to Hasad
11/14/16, 12:41 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Fear is the intermediate state
11/14/16, 12:42 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: khalaqtani min naar
11/14/16, 12:42 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: wa khalaqtahu min theen
11/14/16, 12:42 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: üòß
11/14/16, 12:42 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: And what is hijr
11/14/16, 12:43 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Imagined Hijr which leads to misguidance and Kibr
11/14/16, 12:44 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: How can u prefer him over me...the imagined hijr
11/14/16, 12:44 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hijr was never there
11/14/16, 12:44 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah loves all His creatures
11/14/16, 12:45 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Hijr is from hijrat right? Going from place to another
11/14/16, 12:45 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: no
11/14/16, 12:45 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hijr is abandonment
11/14/16, 12:45 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Leaving
11/14/16, 12:46 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hijrat is migration
11/14/16, 12:46 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Hmmmm akayyy
11/14/16, 12:46 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Both Hijr and Hijrat are Prophetic experiences
11/14/16, 12:46 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Understood
11/14/16, 12:46 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: every prophet went thru hijr and hijrat
11/14/16, 12:47 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: thats why Hijr can either create Shaitaan
11/14/16, 12:47 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and it can alsocreate Prophets
11/14/16, 12:47 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: depending how the Nafs responds to Hijr
11/14/16, 12:48 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Prophets who were  rightly guided never let Fear rule their lives
11/14/16, 12:49 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Never! Even though the hijr they experienced in tjis world was the most severe ever
11/14/16, 12:49 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Why to be afraid when you know that the Almighty is with you
11/14/16, 12:49 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: good question
11/14/16, 12:49 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Allah tests with Fear
11/14/16, 12:50 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: He tested all the Prophets with Fear
11/14/16, 12:50 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: including Rasulullah SAW
11/14/16, 12:51 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: and this fear was of Hijr
11/14/16, 12:51 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: has Allah left me?
11/14/16, 12:53 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Sabir Khauf e Hijr can drive ppl crazy
11/14/16, 12:55 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Abandoned I lie here I am sad

11/14/16, 12:56 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ppl sometimes who lose their Murshid for whatever readon go the path of destruction
11/14/16, 12:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes someone leaving
11/14/16, 12:57 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ppl sometimes who lose their Murshid for whatever reason go the path of destruction
11/14/16, 12:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: its very important to handle them with care
11/14/16, 12:58 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Murshid means?
11/14/16, 12:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hijr can destroy sanity
11/14/16, 12:58 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Not pakistani murshids right????
11/14/16, 12:58 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Our murshid is Quraan and Sunnah
11/14/16, 12:58 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Murshid as in Sheikh or Spiritual Guide...basically one whom you take baet on
11/14/16, 12:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: absolutely
11/14/16, 12:59 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Nobody is taking baet on anyone
11/14/16, 12:59 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: but Spiritual guide is necessary for people especially who have troubled backgrounds or childhoods
11/14/16, 12:59 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: And i think its not required
11/14/16, 1:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ppl still do
11/14/16, 1:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: I see
11/14/16, 1:01 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: I think daawa is necessary for such people
11/14/16, 1:02 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: ok
11/14/16, 1:02 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: When we go far from Islam we get lost....
11/14/16, 1:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: true
11/14/16, 1:03 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: God is our guide
11/14/16, 1:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Supreme Guide
11/14/16, 1:03 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yep
11/14/16, 1:04 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: He says come to me and I will come running to you
11/14/16, 1:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes
11/14/16, 1:05 AM - Sabir Hussain Malik: Ÿà ÿßÿπÿ™ÿµŸÖŸàÿß ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá
11/14/16, 1:11 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: In my experience the ppl who have conflicted childhoods experiencing emotional hijr from parents need a steady guide. Subconsciously the desire for the father whose love was never there.

11/14/16, 11:27 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Amir.... The rich industrialist from the north was horrified to find the southern fisherman lying lazily beside his boat.

‚ÄòWhy aren‚Äôt you out fishing?‚Äô said the industrialist.

‚ÄòBecause I have caught enough fish for the day,‚Äô said the fisherman.

‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you catch some more?‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat would I do with them?‚Äô

‚ÄòYou could earn more money‚Äô was the reply. ‚ÄòWith that you could have a motor fitted to your boat to go into deeper waters and catch more fish. Then you would have enough money to buy nylon nets. These would bring you more fish and more money. Soon you would have enough money to own two boats . . . maybe even a fleet of boats. Then you would be a rich man like me.‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat would I do then?‚Äô

‚ÄòThen you could really enjoy life.‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat do you think I‚Äôm doing right now?‚Äô

11/15/16, 11:23 AM - Amir A. Sattar: salam alikum
11/15/16, 11:34 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: My question is why wasn't media, Imran Khan so aggressive when it came to Zardari's corruption?
11/15/16, 11:34 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: What about the corrupt elements in PTI?
11/15/16, 11:34 AM - Ziad Asghar: Because Imran thought he would win the elections given zardari incompetence.
11/15/16, 11:35 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Yes IK thought he would be the PM
11/15/16, 11:35 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: It is all because of his ego
11/15/16, 11:35 AM - Faisal Farooqi: If PTI ever comes to power and that is a big if then we should hold them to the same standards
11/15/16, 11:36 AM - Ahmer Saleem Baig: Even today why doesn't IK say anything regarding Zardari corruption
11/15/16, 11:36 AM - Faisal Farooqi: But if we can't blame him for problems caused by multiple govts....
11/15/16, 11:37 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Valid point, but why does someone else not speak up about Zardari
11/15/16, 11:37 AM - Ziad Asghar: Pti is in power in KPK.
11/15/16, 11:38 AM - Faisal Farooqi: pml-n and ppp keep shouting in media about having proof againt each other but never do anything
11/15/16, 11:39 AM - Faisal Farooqi: What about pmln in central govt?
11/15/16, 11:40 AM - Ziad Asghar: Yes, so both should be held accountable.  Totally agree.
11/15/16, 11:41 AM - Faisal Farooqi: If PTI is not doing good in KPK they ahould not be elected again. KPK people have proved to be most open minded that they never elected any govt again who did not perform
11/15/16, 11:43 AM - Faisal Farooqi: That was never going to happen with the charter of democracy signed in London üòÄ
11/15/16, 11:44 AM - Faisal Farooqi: We see no end in sight, corrupt in power, incompetent waiting to take turn

11/15/16, 11:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: We are not allowed to talk about politics on this forum
11/15/16, 11:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: Just saying
11/15/16, 11:45 AM - Ziad Asghar: Exactly, if pmln is not doing good on the center then they should not be elected again but not via external angles.
11/15/16, 11:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: But given your freedom of speech
11/15/16, 11:45 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Admins have veto power üòá
11/15/16, 11:45 AM - Mashood Yunus: Please carry onüòÄüòÇüòú
11/15/16, 11:46 AM - Mashood Yunus: And I'm on the side of Edmunds
11/15/16, 11:46 AM - Mashood Yunus: Administration
11/15/16, 11:46 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I think we are collectively tired of being made fools from both govt and opposition üò¢
11/15/16, 11:47 AM - Mashood Yunus: Absolutely
11/15/16, 11:47 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Only party or individuals change but things keep going on as usual
11/15/16, 11:48 AM - Mashood Yunus: Pakistan has survived, alhamdulillah and you know why but we need change
11/15/16, 11:48 AM - Faisal Farooqi: So who captured the best picture of supermoon... how is that for a topic?
11/15/16, 11:49 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Another important announcement, 2 month anniversary of group üéâüç∞
11/15/16, 11:49 AM - Ziad Asghar: Yes, and some are now being fooled by rejects from all of the same parties.
11/15/16, 11:49 AM - Ziad Asghar: One man cannot run a laundering operation to clean up all those people.  :)
11/15/16, 11:52 AM - Faisal Farooqi: That is true, when IK had good agenda and good folks working with him he had a single seat.... once he started accepting the lotas he won seats but lost good people and direction.....
11/15/16, 11:53 AM - Faisal Farooqi: So I wonder how a good set of folks with no relation to corrupt mafia will ever come to power
11/15/16, 11:57 AM - Ziad Asghar: He is still on power in the center and diluted further while he flies in the KPK government helicopter and the plane of a public sugar mill whose ceo happens to be Tareen who btw shows up with a few offshore companies of his own.
11/15/16, 11:57 AM - Ziad Asghar: *not in
11/15/16, 12:04 PM - Faisal Farooqi: My only point is that when we put him under the microscope others should not be given a free pass
11/15/16, 12:08 PM - Ziad Asghar: Agree,  but his whole differentiation is or was that he was clean and hence the scrutiny.
11/15/16, 12:09 PM - Faisal Farooqi: In other news I am thinking of taking a break from whatsapp groups for a few days.... have some days off from work and want to avoid spending all time on groups üòá
11/15/16, 12:10 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Any add requests should be directed to Ziad... don't think there would be many since we found almost everyone who was discoverable
11/15/16, 12:12 PM - Shakil Ahmed: or who caught the biggest fish
11/15/16, 12:27 PM - Abdul Hafeez: Interesting...
11/15/16, 12:35 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: I hope he becomes PM one day. He DESIRES  power there is no doubt. We will see what he does.
11/15/16, 12:38 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Narcissists know how to work their charm on people with liw self esteem. We see them all around. Give a little and then eventually take a lot. Its all about THEM in the end when the dust settles.
11/15/16, 12:38 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: *low

Log apnay defense k liye wakeel krtay hein shareer family direct judge hi kr laytay hein. 

Awam may aqel hoti to yahan tek noubet hi na phonchtee. 

Zara sochein.
11/15/16, 2:49 PM - Amer Aslam: Yaad rhay k justice sajjad Ali shah in 1997 may nawaz shareer ki corruption k case may hukum nhin mana to nawaz shareer nay Supreme Court per hamla kra diya tha aur saray judges ko jaan bacha kr bhagna pera tha.
11/15/16, 3:00 PM - Amer Aslam: " one man" is always responsible for fate of millions.

11/15/16, 3:23 PM - Amer Aslam: Dekhein ilkhtilaaf to sahaba may bhi tha , lkin woh nazriye ikhtilaaf nhin tha. 

Yani nazriya aik tha lkin kisi kaam ko krnay k tereeqay may ikhtilaaf ho sakta hai. 

Kisi kaam k krnay may woh sub muttafiq hotay thay k Huzur saw ka hukum hota tha lkin tereeqay k baray yani k kaisay krna hai yani k khandeq khodni hai ya direct agay ja kr face krna may ikhtilaaf ho sakta hai. 

Isee baat per Huzur saw nay Allah talaa say sahaba k ikhtilaaf k baray poocha to Allah talaa nay fermaya mafhoom hai " App k saray sahaba sitaron ki manend hein , jo aap ki umet may jis sahabi ki itibaa ya perwee kray ga falah Paye ga. ". 

Isee tera corruption pay Erdogan pti same hein. 

Aik hein. 

Maslun masjid bananay may hum sub mutafiq hon gay lkin kis jaga banay is may hum sub may ikhtilaaf ho ga. 

Ya masjid k ander sahin kahan ho , do storey ho ya 3 stories. Yani in cheezein may hum sub mukhtalif raye dein gay. 

Maslun apnay bachon ko perhana chahiye koi ikhtilaaf nhin. Lkin kiya. !!!!! 

Engineering, doctor , software testers , developers , space sciences. , bohat ikhtilaaf hai. Etc etc. etc.

Is liye hum boycott krtay hein.

11/17/16, 12:43 PM - Inamullah Qamar: Strange, Isn't it,
11/17/16, 12:47 PM - Inamullah Qamar: Saqib Kamran????? 
Kon!
11/17/16, 12:48 PM - Faisal Farooqi: No, Saqib Ejaz
11/17/16, 12:49 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: Why do you find it strange?
11/17/16, 12:49 PM - Inamullah Qamar: So true yar!
11/17/16, 12:53 PM - Aroosh Rizwan Elahi: A whole bunch of so called muslims elites supported the foundation of Pakistan as an opportunity to line their own pockets and oppress the poor...
11/17/16, 1:04 PM - Mashood Yunus: Yup, there are always these opportunists ...
11/17/16, 1:11 PM - Mashood Yunus: Rest was true for just like any other state freeing themselves lves from colonialism, many things were against Pakistan. There was a reason for two groups of muslims scholars, one for it and other listing cautions about having it.  The two groups exist today too :)
11/17/16, 1:24 PM - Faraz Kashif: He was clearly against making of Pakistan and told Jinnah Sahab the reasons as mentioned in the video

 Jinnah Sahab tried his level best to share his Vision with him but to no avail

These are not his predictions 
These were his teachings and he taught them well 
There are still many in Pakistan and India that believe that she should have never been founded and that they would have been better off without her existence 

Yeh Mulk in sab kay bawajood Allah kay naam parr wajood may aya 
ALHAMDULILLAH 

Kaash Jinnah Sahab ko chand saal aur mill jatay 
This country would be in a much better shape now
11/17/16, 1:25 PM - Inamullah Qamar: üëçüèª
11/17/16, 1:26 PM - Inamullah Qamar: Indeed agreed.
11/17/16, 1:28 PM - Faraz Kashif: Twisting someone's teachings and calling them predictions is the job of news media 
Ratings matter more to them
11/17/16, 1:35 PM - Faraz Kashif: ~Modi is preparing to visit Trump soon to show how well he makes tea that inspired obama 

~Isreal is preparing to visit Modi 

~While Ergogan stays in Pakistan for now

11/17/16, 9:57 PM - Amer Aslam: Bohat beray bewaqoof yaar. 

In ko kiya zarooret thee k pata tha kuch nhin hona.  Phir sub ka time zaya kerwa diya.
11/17/16, 9:58 PM - Ziad Asghar: They had great proofs, like Facebook pictures and YouTube videos.  Court is being unreasonable.. üòä
11/17/16, 9:58 PM - Amer Aslam: I am with u. Fikr not.
11/17/16, 9:58 PM - Amer Aslam: Yeah right.

11/17/16, 10:02 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Every soul in Pakistan knows what the rulers have done, however just like Zardari I am sure there is no solid proof against NS either
11/17/16, 10:02 PM - Ziad Asghar: Courts need real proofs not YouTube videos.
11/17/16, 10:03 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Ayyan Ali was caught with all that money.... what came out of that
11/17/16, 10:03 PM - Ziad Asghar: And when you make this much noise people assume you actually might have some real proof.
11/17/16, 10:03 PM - Ziad Asghar: I think her case is still going on but that is a different case.
11/17/16, 10:03 PM - Amer Aslam: Ziad theek keh rhay ho.
11/17/16, 10:03 PM - Amer Aslam: Bilkul.
11/17/16, 10:03 PM - Ziad Asghar: Good to hear that... :)
11/17/16, 10:04 PM - Amer Aslam: Durest
11/17/16, 10:04 PM - Faisal Farooqi: If NS lies in parliament other than video and court transcript what else is required?
11/17/16, 10:04 PM - Ziad Asghar: But that is not what pti lawyer is showing in the court.
11/17/16, 10:04 PM - Amer Aslam: Faisal aqel bhi chahiye aur iman bhi.
11/17/16, 10:04 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Our NAB can not nab anyone
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Amer Aslam: Pti lawyer jack ass wastage of time n money.  
Good for nothing.
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Ziad Asghar: That is my point, they are I'll prepared.  It is not a dharna speech, you need real documents and facts.  And you have to prove that N lied.
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Amer Aslam: U r right ziad
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Amer Aslam: Bilkul
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Ziad Asghar: I know I am right...
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Amer Aslam: Exactly documents to jala diye na.
11/17/16, 10:05 PM - Amer Aslam: Yup
11/17/16, 10:06 PM - Ziad Asghar: Acha, you were there amer..
11/17/16, 10:06 PM - Faisal Farooqi: In fact the govt departments who are tasked to investigate such matters came to court and said thet their charter does not include investigating sitting govt
11/17/16, 10:06 PM - Amer Aslam: Lahore ki building may aag. Kuch yaad kro.
11/17/16, 10:07 PM - Ziad Asghar: Faisal,  now they have a chance but first they submit 600 pages of news clippings and now he is reading Ns speeches like he has never prosecuted a case.
11/17/16, 10:07 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Lets say PTI does not raise this matter up, does that mean we let govt after govt keep on looting the country?
11/17/16, 10:07 PM - Amer Aslam: 15 min bathroom break. Ok
11/17/16, 10:08 PM - Faisal Farooqi: If tomorrow anyone else comes up with better organized proof I will be with them
11/17/16, 10:08 PM - Ziad Asghar: My point is simple, why are they so ill prepared for the case that sc judges are scolding them.
11/17/16, 10:08 PM - Ziad Asghar: Raise the matter but can't bring a shred of proof.
11/17/16, 10:09 PM - Faisal Farooqi: They are ill prepared because of all the trogan horses and lotas in the party
11/17/16, 10:09 PM - Ziad Asghar: Whose party is it??
11/17/16, 10:09 PM - Ziad Asghar: sharifs?
11/17/16, 10:10 PM - Ziad Asghar: Incompetence should not be encouraged whether with sharifs or with pti..
11/17/16, 10:10 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I am sure there are elements in PTI who do ot want the precedence of accountability to be set
11/17/16, 10:10 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Other they may face it in future too
11/17/16, 10:11 PM - Ziad Asghar: Why can't khan overrule them when like he overruled the justice that was in charge of elections within pti.
11/17/16, 10:11 PM - Ziad Asghar: The justice suggested that tareen be removed.
11/17/16, 10:11 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Removal of that guy was the downfall of PTI
11/17/16, 10:11 PM - Ziad Asghar: He over ruled him and threw him out of the party.
11/17/16, 10:12 PM - Ziad Asghar: http://www.dawn.com/news/1198553
11/17/16, 10:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Became tareen is ptis atm.  And btw he will recoup his investments when he gets a chance.
11/17/16, 10:13 PM - Ziad Asghar: Because
11/17/16, 10:14 PM - Faisal Farooqi: The way I see it is that either I get some sort of solid proof myself, help someone else get the proof or at the very least hope that the one fighting for the proof finds something
11/17/16, 10:15 PM - Faisal Farooqi: While I am not doing anything I can not fault the one guy who is trying
11/17/16, 10:15 PM - Ziad Asghar: I fault him for creating so much noise without proof.  It is incompetence and a long term election prep in the absence of real proof.
11/17/16, 10:16 PM - Ziad Asghar: Incompetence and stupidity is also a crime at these levels.  And this from an Oxford educated politician.
11/17/16, 10:17 PM - Faisal Farooqi: It is but I go back to my earlier statement, if I am not doing a better job at it I can not blame the guy trying
11/17/16, 10:19 PM - Amer Aslam: Yaad rhay k doosray mulkon k wazerron ko panama papers may naam aanay k baad istifaa dayna pera. 

Un k wakeelon ya Awam nay adalet may yeh kiyon nhin kaha k bhai yeh to fb news aur YouTube videos hein. ???

11/17/16, 10:20 PM - Ziad Asghar: Not true,  and his name is not in the papers either if you want to be accurate.
11/17/16, 10:21 PM - Ziad Asghar: And khan sahib has an offshore company as well as you might know.
11/17/16, 10:22 PM - Ziad Asghar: https://m.geo.tv/#category%7Clatest-news%7Cp105776-imran-khan-confirms-he-made-an-offshore-company-to-avoid-taxes
11/17/16, 10:22 PM - Ziad Asghar: Should he resign?
11/17/16, 10:33 PM - Ziad Asghar: And for the heck of it, here is a list of all heads of state in Panama leaks and only the Iceland PM resigned.  List_of_people_named_in_the_Panama_Papers
11/17/16, 10:36 PM - Ziad Asghar: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_named_in_the_Panama_Papers
11/17/16, 10:42 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faisal : Whoever is trying then we wish him success. But all this hoopla and knowing the Pakistani circumstances IK wasted everyone's time and raised false hopes. This was only a self-serving political move for the next polls.
11/17/16, 10:44 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: He wants to be PM. Thats it.
11/17/16, 10:46 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Everyone has their fix. NS money. IK absolute power.
11/17/16, 10:48 PM - Ziad Asghar: Zardari just got a kick out of playing evil games.
11/17/16, 10:49 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Zardari is like.....

11/17/16, 10:51 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòà
11/17/16, 10:56 PM - Shakil Ahmed: hmmmm
11/17/16, 11:01 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I am not sure what is the issue with wasting time, if positive change does not come through democratic process then eventually a revolution takes or a take over from opportunist enemy happens. A nation suffers much greater loss in either of these
11/17/16, 11:02 PM - Shakil Ahmed: proof..... it's all over
11/17/16, 11:02 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I do not care if IK comes to power or not, my hope is that younger generation stands up for their right
11/17/16, 11:03 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: That is the only way üëç
11/17/16, 11:04 PM - Shakil Ahmed: I want him to be PM as well........ why not yar
11/17/16, 11:04 PM - Shakil Ahmed: lol
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: People need to change themselves first  otherwise humans cant oppose the Sunnah of Allah.
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: cant happen
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: it just cant
11/17/16, 11:05 PM - Shakil Ahmed: üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
11/17/16, 11:07 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Again even all his faults IK is the only one who has shown the common man that standing up for their right is possible (this can mot be said for many in his party) One of these days someone else will come up and do a much better job than IK in running a party and throwing out the thiefs running the show
11/17/16, 11:07 PM - Shakil Ahmed: yes.... tabdeeli aa gai hai
11/17/16, 11:07 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: When compassion and empathy is missing from the masses then Tyrants are a reality to expect
11/17/16, 11:07 PM - Shakil Ahmed: üëçüëçüëçüôÇüôÇüôÇ
11/17/16, 11:07 PM - Shakil Ahmed: IK is tge most empathetic
11/17/16, 11:08 PM - Shakil Ahmed: IK is training the masses
11/17/16, 11:08 PM - Shakil Ahmed: aawaaz uthao

11/17/16, 11:09 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: What he is calling for is to Demand (Take your rights)

11/17/16, 11:09 PM - Ziad Asghar: You should listen to the dharna speeches..
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: what I am saying is learning to GIVE unconditionally to fellow humans
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Ziad... much better than others fixing their naaaaalay
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Ziad, tell me will anyone get inspired by the speeches of pmln or ppp?
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: its not TAKING but rather GIVING that brings Allah's help
11/17/16, 11:10 PM - Ziad Asghar: I actually hoped he would win in 2018 but he is an idiot so unlikely

11/17/16, 11:11 PM - Shakil Ahmed: lol
11/17/16, 11:11 PM - Faisal Farooqi: IK winning is not the goal, we need to get to a system of fairness
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Shakil plus the man who did not even GIVE credit to his team for world cup win in his speech is not capable of GIVING
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: these are just ploys to come in power
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - Shakil Ahmed: we want the system to win
11/17/16, 11:12 PM - Ziad Asghar: Exactly.. the arrogance is unbelievable
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Narcissist!
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Shakil Ahmed: a new system where a neighbor will not dump trash next to their neighbor
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Shakil Ahmed: khudi
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Shakil Ahmed: khuddaari
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Faisal Farooqi: I agree that many of us are disappointed in IK and PTI for raising false hopes
11/17/16, 11:13 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Arrogance is NOT khudi

11/17/16, 11:14 PM - Ziad Asghar: Shakeeel just failed urdu literature
11/17/16, 11:14 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: He is the spoilt child.. Narcissist
11/17/16, 11:15 PM - Shakil Ahmed: IK is still the hope
11/17/16, 11:15 PM - Ziad Asghar: Hardly
11/17/16, 11:15 PM - Shakil Ahmed: lol
11/17/16, 11:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Let us experience a TRUE Narcissist as a leader. I will vote for IK  next elections
11/17/16, 11:16 PM - Ziad Asghar: True story
11/17/16, 11:16 PM - Ziad Asghar: üòä
11/17/16, 11:16 PM - Shakil Ahmed: there is thin line between khudi and takabbur
11/17/16, 11:16 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: yes and the nation fails to see that
11/17/16, 11:17 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: exactly my point
11/17/16, 11:17 PM - Ziad Asghar: He crossed that line such that the line is a dot to him
11/17/16, 11:17 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Narcissists are known to exploit this caveat
11/17/16, 11:18 PM - Shakil Ahmed: yar I don't think IK is that
11/17/16, 11:18 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: That's an opinion bro I respect that
11/17/16, 11:19 PM - Ziad Asghar: It is naive opinion
11/17/16, 11:19 PM - Ziad Asghar: A
11/17/16, 11:19 PM - Shakil Ahmed: not any more than others, at least
11/17/16, 11:19 PM - Shakil Ahmed: naive... no
11/17/16, 11:19 PM - Shakil Ahmed: think about it
11/17/16, 11:20 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Shakil do u know the characteristics of a Narcissist?
11/17/16, 11:20 PM - Shakil Ahmed: yes i do
11/17/16, 11:20 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Revisit them bro
11/17/16, 11:22 PM - Shakil Ahmed: there are different levels and types.....  https://hbr.org/2004/01/narcissistic-leaders-the-incredible-pros-the-inevitable-cons
11/17/16, 11:24 PM - Shakil Ahmed: it's COULD work if YOUR intent is linked with PEOPLE
11/17/16, 11:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: then u r not a Narcissist
11/17/16, 11:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: the very definition of a Narcissist is SELF SERVING
11/17/16, 11:24 PM - Shakil Ahmed: there are three parties here
11/17/16, 11:24 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: incapable of GIVING
11/17/16, 11:25 PM - Shakil Ahmed: me, you and what I want
11/17/16, 11:25 PM - Shakil Ahmed: I don't care what YOU want, but what I want is good of.PEOPLE
11/17/16, 11:26 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hardly the way they think. Narcissist is about self glory
11/17/16, 11:27 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Throughout history, narcissists have always emerged to inspire people and to shape the future. When military, religious, and political arenas dominated society, it was figures such as Napol√©on Bonaparte, Mahatma Gandhi, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt who determined the social agenda.
11/17/16, 11:27 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: The taste is in the pudding
11/17/16, 11:27 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: these are after the fact....facts
11/17/16, 11:28 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: I say we vote him in. I am all for it. His bloody drama is going on for 20 years
11/17/16, 11:28 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: He deserves to be PM just for his persistence
11/17/16, 11:29 PM - Ziad Asghar: Haha
11/17/16, 11:29 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Let's get over with it already
11/17/16, 11:29 PM - Ziad Asghar: He is not helping his case
11/17/16, 11:30 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: watch his worldcup speech for goodness sake
11/17/16, 11:30 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Bloody Ana Parast
11/17/16, 11:30 PM - Amer Aslam: <Media omitted>
11/17/16, 11:31 PM - Shakil Ahmed: But from time to time, when business became the engine of social change, it, too, generated its share of narcissistic leaders. That was true at the beginning of this century, when men like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford exploited new technologies and restructured American industry.
11/17/16, 11:31 PM - Shakil Ahmed: lol
11/17/16, 11:31 PM - Shakil Ahmed: do you remember sir Chaudhry?

11/17/16, 11:33 PM - Shakil Ahmed: €å€Å €ÅŸàÿ¶ ŸÜÿß ÿ®ÿßÿ™
11/17/16, 11:33 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Wrong words where they mattered the most
11/17/16, 11:34 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Look closely the people the choice of words
11/17/16, 11:34 PM - Shakil Ahmed: future words.....

11/17/16, 11:35 PM - Shakil Ahmed: I worked day and night for this country, and I made a new Pakistan
11/17/16, 11:35 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Read Ihya Ulumuddin where Ghazali has dissected the Zahir and Batin
11/17/16, 11:36 PM - Shakil Ahmed: zahir ye hai ke NS and Zrd nay loota
11/17/16, 11:36 PM - Shakil Ahmed: baari baari
11/17/16, 11:36 PM - Shakil Ahmed: like ping pong
11/17/16, 11:37 PM - Shakil Ahmed: tuk tuk
11/17/16, 11:37 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: I an talking about a man and his personal facade
11/17/16, 11:37 PM - Shakil Ahmed: tuk tuk
11/17/16, 11:37 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Aqeel... agreed yaar.... beauty is only skin deep
11/17/16, 11:54 PM - Shakil Ahmed: ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ±€åÿßŸàÿßŸÑÿß

11/17/16, 11:58 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal nay typing ka faisla kiya hai
11/17/16, 11:58 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: heheh
11/17/16, 11:58 PM - Shakil Ahmed: no?
11/17/16, 11:58 PM - Faisal Farooqi: Ok guys I am out, I do not see a end in sight to a discussion where we are spending more time criticizing someone who is trying to do something. We need to talk about what we can do
11/17/16, 11:59 PM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal..... agree
11/17/16, 11:59 PM - Shakil Ahmed: have a good night
11/17/16, 11:59 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Faisal my vote is for PTI
11/18/16, 12:00 AM - Faisal Farooqi: If we go back to Pakistan and struggle ourselves then we earn the right to point out the issues with IK or anyone for that matter
11/18/16, 12:00 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: the rants are for saving myself from the fallouts of IK winning. He needs a chance
11/18/16, 12:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: IK for PM. Admins record it Please.
11/18/16, 12:01 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: üòÑ
11/18/16, 12:02 AM - Faisal Farooqi: In my opinion the solution is education, an area where we can make direct impact
11/18/16, 12:02 AM - Shakil Ahmed: Faisal.... he is
11/18/16, 12:02 AM - Ziad Asghar: No, IK is a public figure and is open for criticism like all others.
11/18/16, 12:03 AM - Shakil Ahmed: sure....
11/18/16, 12:03 AM - Shakil Ahmed: criticize
11/18/16, 12:03 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Sure but ignoring NS and Zardari and keeping the guns pointed at IK at all times in not fair either
11/18/16, 12:03 AM - Ziad Asghar: If someone is wrong, perhaps your criticism might make him better.
11/18/16, 12:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Evil is evil Faisal
11/18/16, 12:04 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes... IF... PERHAPS
11/18/16, 12:04 AM - Ziad Asghar: It should be all of them.  We know NS and Zardari but people have made this idol of Imran and it is not healthy.
11/18/16, 12:04 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Someone claiming to be  a Savior needs to be  under Scrutiny
11/18/16, 12:04 AM - Shakil Ahmed: sure
11/18/16, 12:04 AM - Ziad Asghar: Read up the CA courses paternity ruling against him.
11/18/16, 12:05 AM - Ziad Asghar: Courts
11/18/16, 12:05 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yes that
11/18/16, 12:05 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: IK is a spoilt child. And he has given Hijr to use our discussion lingo to a child
11/18/16, 12:05 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Hardly signs of a Savior
11/18/16, 12:05 AM - Shakil Ahmed: not savior
11/18/16, 12:05 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I sound like a broken record here, if all we do is criticize but do not do anything ourselves then we are no better.... our education gone wasted
11/18/16, 12:06 AM - Shakil Ahmed: people want to save themselves
11/18/16, 12:06 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Anyways... I said I am out üòÄ
11/18/16, 12:06 AM - Ziad Asghar: We can be doing things and don't need to talk about here to toot our horn.
11/18/16, 12:06 AM - Shakil Ahmed: there is no way IK can do on his own
11/18/16, 12:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: Saviors are victims of Hijr not perpetrators of Hijr
11/18/16, 12:06 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: History teaches us
11/18/16, 12:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: exactly
11/18/16, 12:07 AM - Mohammad Aqeel: many ppl do things secretly
11/18/16, 12:07 AM - Shakil Ahmed: yup

11/18/16, 12:57 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Let me start it...
11/18/16, 1:07 AM - Adnan Ali: What ever criticism we might have of IK, his personal deeds have not harmed a nation.....yet.

Taxi Boats, private trolling boats make it hard

Didn't know at first but he was the same Qari Sahab that taught Imran Farhat also

Very polite and nice person, always smiled and kept us engaged in recitation 

May Allah grant him good place in Jannat

11/19/16, 9:19 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Cognitive dissonance.  Its a BITCH!
11/19/16, 9:27 PM - Faraz Kashif: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance

Check out the example >>>
11/19/16, 9:33 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: This calls for some Nine Inch Nails

11/19/16, 9:46 PM - Faraz Kashif: Privilege these grunge bands (GEN X) had was knowing what they were going thru 
Their emotional intellect was high and they knew how to cope with their conditions, one way or another 

They used music to express their issues, to reach out to people, and to help the likes of them

Unlike most people that undermine it, Lyrics are what makes or breaks a Band in US.

All grunge bands, every single one was hit.
Main reason = Self Realisation and expressing need for cure
11/19/16, 9:48 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: all the while The Mullah slept (and continues to do so).....the sheep continue their march..
11/19/16, 9:52 PM - Faraz Kashif: I have so much in this regard Aqeel Jaani 

But me and Amir Sattar had a discussion last night. His cousin went thru a life changing experience recently. He felt the pain of deportation with entire family

It would be wise for everyone here in Place #2 to refrain.......
11/19/16, 9:53 PM - Faraz Kashif: Sooooo much to say
11/19/16, 9:54 PM - Faraz Kashif: First step Self Realisation 
Than desire for Cure 
Than Salvation 

Salvation doesnt come easy
11/19/16, 10:03 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: Doodh ka jala.
11/19/16, 10:09 PM - Faraz Kashif: Phir jaani tughay

11/19/16, 10:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: All the while DSM inflates in size every revision, we the Muslims the supposedly Saviors of the World continue wander aimlessly.
11/19/16, 10:10 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: *to
11/19/16, 10:11 PM - Mohammad Aqeel: We closed the doors on our own voices of reason from the Past.
11/19/16, 10:14 PM - Faraz Kashif: Some in denial
Some in suppression 
Some waiting for courage
Some ........

11/20/16, 12:46 AM - Ziad Asghar: Yes and that is why Amer should not believe Facebook news. üòä
11/20/16, 12:54 AM - Faisal Farooqi: Amer mentioned once that he is not on facebook
11/20/16, 12:54 AM - Faisal Farooqi: I guess he would have to clarify the source üòÄ

11/20/16, 5:41 AM - Amer Aslam: There's fine line between cognitive dissonance n speaking the truth.



Amir gaya aur aik aur Uae no gone. 

So read btw the lines. 

Aur bhi bohat hein Uae say numbers. Un ko bhi khatra hai. Yeh batein hum na krein yahan to bohat behter. 

Note :Arabs hate cognitive dissonance to an extent of deportation. Plz refrain. 

Akhir hum bhi to wahan rehtay rhay hein aur is dour may jis may 1960 & 1970 jis may humaray waldein gay wahan k ager USA ya U.K. Atay to ghulam hotay. 

Bus k peechay bethna perta. 
Koi schooling na hoti. 

Aur ager hoti to segregated schools hotay. 

Bahir nikeltay hi moun per Thooka jata. 

Aur jahan goray hotay wahan ja na saktay. 

Khanay peenay ki tables aur bathrooms tek aleg aleg hotay. 

Aur gratuities ho bhi jatay yahan us waqit to job kon dayta. 

Mera khayal hai k arebon may humaray waldein nay aur hum sub nay beri shahana zindagi guzari hai. 

Ager kisi " scientist" ko yaqeen na aaye to uncle google say beshuk pooch lein aur uncle google say woh pic bhi mangein jis may goray aik kalay ko peker kr us say jootay ko chatnay ko keh rhay hein. 

Ab sochein k us kalay ki jaga hum may say koi ya humaray waldein hotay. 

To hum nay bohat acha waqit guzara wahan.  

Aur is ko baaar baar uchalna theek nhin doosron ko khatra hai.
11/20/16, 5:43 AM - Amer Aslam: Always speak n follow truth. 

Na k gora kray to patriot, kala kray to enemy of state. 

Yeh hai gora mentality jo k kayee mulkon may kalay bhi senselessly follow krtay hein.
11/20/16, 6:05 AM - Amer Aslam: Erdogannay sirf modi nhin 33 aur leaders ki stamps bhi print ki hein. 

Yeh interest nhin hotay. Musalman leaders sub say miltay rhay hein. 

Kiya Huzur saw nhin milay kufar say ? Kiya Huzur saw nay kufar say muahiday nhin kiye? 

Kiya Huzur saw nay kayee sahaba ki shahdet k baad bhi muahiday nhin kiye kufar say?to is say kiya sabit hoa k jo shaheed hoay un ki shahdetein zaya ho Gayeen. Her giz nhin. 


Aur humaray samnay Huzur saw ki misal moujood hai her cheez may. 

Erdogan nay Israel say bhi Palestine k musalmano k liye muahiday kiye aur India may to bhai pakistan say zyada musalman hein. Met bhoolein. 
 

Log ilzam us waqit quaid e azam pay bhi lagatay thay jub in ki koi aik trsweer bhi lord mount baten k sath aa jati. Ya kisi bhi goray k sath k yeh to ghadaar hai , Goron k sath hai. 

Humein thori aqel say kaam layna chahiye. Yeh ilzam to quaid e azam pay her waqit lagta tha.

11/20/16, 6:09 AM - Faraz Kashif: *I disagree* that our parents and us would have been GHULAM, no schooling, job restrictions etc.

Emancipation Proclamation was in 1863 
MLK was assassinated in 1968
All his hard work was done by than
 
I was in BAMA for sometime
In 60's and 70's things were getting much better with Traces of Segregation 

The bright side: 
Parents medical care and retirement plan
Plus they would have a *HOME*

Highlighted cause its not made of bricks or logs
Its the mental state of mind that  provides solid grounds and extension to future vision and much more......
Most parents dont have that here 

*KABBHI BHI PATTA KAT SAKTA HAY YAHAN SAY* fear demolishes a man and puts him to his knees 


I am not complaining, these are facts
Allah Pak ka Lakh sukar ada karta hoon aur acchay ke umeed rakhta hoon 

Allah pak sab kay haq may behtar karay 

*Ameen*
11/20/16, 6:09 AM - Amer Aslam: Quaid e azam musalmano k khilaaf Mountbatten k sath conspiracy krtay hoay aur qah qahay lagatay hoay.
11/20/16, 6:11 AM - Amer Aslam: Patta to yaar yahan say bhi kut sakta hai.
